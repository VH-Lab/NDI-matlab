# Learning Matlab

Currently NDI is available only in Matlab. If you are new to Matlab, there are resources to help you learn.

## Short tutorials

1. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html)

2. A very [short tutorial](https://peeps.unet.brandeis.edu/~pmiller/COMP_NEURO/matlab-tut.html) Steve made as a TA for Computational Neuroscience in the early 2000s.

3. MathWorks's own [onboarding tutorial](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html?ef_id=Cj0KCQjwweyFBhDvARIsAA67M73Nl7zid86YbB4ul4lZ7GS1Rjs5_lihQFV6y4RXUa-oiHRN1_CAHqQaAtdTEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!8664!3!429145757409!b!!g!!%2Bmatlab%20%2Btutorial&s_eid=ppc_108293288628&q=+matlab%20+tutorial&gclid=Cj0KCQjwweyFBhDvARIsAA67M73Nl7zid86YbB4ul4lZ7GS1Rjs5_lihQFV6y4RXUa-oiHRN1_CAHqQaAtdTEALw_wcB).

## For people with no coding experience

Some people want to learn to use NDI but do not have coding experience. These resources were suggested by our new users.

### Classes and objects

1. Mo writes: Learn what a class and object is. I was completely stuck in terms of conceptually understanding what was going on in the code before I knew what classes and objects were. I recommend this [video from CSdojo on YouTube]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjkWGRlUmY&t=522s]).

### Mo's newbie notes

1. If you see a function that you don't know, it doesn't hurt to try using the `help` function in the command window. Just type in the word help followed by whatever you don't understand. For example, suppose I don't understand what `gca` is. I would type `help gca`.

2. You can double click the things saved in the workspace to see their contents.

3. You can use the editor to write and save code. I used this a lot for just saving all the code from the tutorial on one page. 

4. If you remove the semi-colon at the end of a line, Matlab will print out the properties of the object.

## Online courses

1.  Steve's semester-long course Data Analysis and Statistics Workshop is for new or experienced coders. It has 22 self-paced "labs" that are designed to take between 60 - 80 minutes. It is available [free to the public](http://dataclass.vhlab.org).
