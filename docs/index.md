# NDI

## About

[NDI](http://ndi.vhlab.org) (Neuroscience Data Interface) is a cross-platform interface standard for reading neuroscience data and storing the results of analyses. Who inspires NDI?

- As an **analyst**, I want to quickly open my colleagues' data, regardless of its format and organization, so we can make discoveries.

- As a **researcher**, I want my data records and analysis steps to be annotated and both human and machine readable, so I can review my teammates' work and share these annotated results with the world. I want these annotations to occur *in situ*, not as a separate step that I do later.

- As a **physiologist/imager**, I want my analysis routines to have access to my data the instant it is recorded, so I can make choices about how to proceed during my experiment. 

- As an **analyst**, I want to write one set of analysis routines that do not need to be revised to work with new data formats or new data organizations.

- As a **scientist**, I want to search for data or analyses from other researchers.

- As an **amateur**, I want to be able to access scientists' raw data to perform my own analyses.

NDI is inspired by [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles.
