# CLASS ndi.time.syncgraph

```
  ndi.time.syncgraph - create a new ndi.time.syncgraph object
 
  NDI_SYNCGRAPH_OBJ = ndi.time.syncgraph(SESSION)
  
  Builds a new ndi.time.syncgraph object and sets its SESSION
  property to SESSION, which should be an ndi.session object.
 
  This function can be called in another form:
  NDI_SYNCGRAPH_OBJ = ndi.time.syncgraph(SESSION, NDI_DOCUMENT_OBJ)
  where NDI_DOCUMENT_OBJ is an ndi.document of class ndi_document_syncgraph.

```

---

**graphinfo** - *return the graph information*

```
The graph information GINFO is a structure with the following fields:
  Fieldname              | Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  nodes                  | The epochnodes (see ndi.epoch.epochset/EPOCHNODE)
  G                      | The epoch node graph adjacency matrix. G(i,j) is the cost of
                         |   converting between node i and j.

**id** - *return the identifier of an ndi.ido object*

```
IDENTIFIER = ID(NDI_ID_OBJ)
 
  Returns the unique identifier of an ndi.ido object.

---

**load_all_syncgraph_docs** - *load a syncgraph document and all of its syncrules*

```
[SYNCGRAPH_DOC, SYNCRULE_DOCS] = LOAD_ALL_SYNCGRAPH_DOCS(NDI_SESSION_OBJ,...
 					SYNCGRAPH_DOC_ID)
 
  Given an ndi.session object and the document identifier of an ndi.time.syncgraph object,
  this function loads the ndi.document associated with the SYNCGRAPH (SYNCGRAPH_DOC) and all of
  the documents of its SYNCRULES (cell array of NDI_DOCUMENTS in SYNCRULES_DOC).
```

**ndi_unique_id** - *Generate a unique ID number for NDI projects*

```
ID = NDI_UNIQUE_ID
 
  Generates a unique ID character array based on the current time and a random
  number. It is a hexidecimal representation of the serial date number in
  UTC Leap Seconds time. The serial date number is the number of days since January 0, 0000 at 0:00:00.
  The integer portion of the date is the whole number of days and the fractional part of the date number
  is the fraction of days.
 
  ID = [NUM2HEX(SERIAL_DATE_NUMBER) '_' NUM2HEX(RAND)]
 
  See also: NUM2HEX, NOW, RAND

  Attempts to convert a time T_IN that is referred to by ndi.time.timereference object TIMEREF_IN 
  to T_OUT that is referred to by the requested REFERENT_OUT object (must be type ndi.epoch.epochset and NDI_BASE)
  with the requested ndi.time.clocktype CLOCKTYPE_OUT.
  
  T_OUT is the output time with respect to the ndi.time.timereference TIMEREF_OUT that incorporates REFERENT_OUT
  and CLOCKTYPE_OUT with the appropriate epoch and time reference.
 
  If the conversion cannot be made, T_OUT is empty and MSG contains a text message describing
  why the conversion could not be made.
