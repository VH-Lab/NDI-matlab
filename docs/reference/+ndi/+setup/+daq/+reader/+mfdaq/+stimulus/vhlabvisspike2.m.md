# CLASS ndi.setup.daq.reader.mfdaq.stimulus.vhlabvisspike2

```
  NDI_DAQREADER_MFDAQ_STIMULUS_VHLABVISSPIKE2 - Device object for vhlab visual stimulus computer
 
  This device reads the 'stimtimes.txt', 'verticalblanking.txt', 'stims.mat', and 'spike2data.smr' files
  that are present in directories where a VHLAB stimulus computer (running NewStim/RunExperiment)
  has produced triggers that have been acquired on a CED Spike2 system running the VHLAB Spike2 script.
 
  This device produces the following event channels in each epoch. They are not read from the CED SMR
  file but instead are read from the .txt files that are generated by the vhlab scripts.
 
  Channel name:   | Signal description:
  ----------------|------------------------------------------
  mk1             | stimulus on/off
  mk2             | stimid 
  e1              | frame trigger
  e2              | vertical refresh trigger
  e3              | pretime trigger

  is the fraction of days.
 
  ID = [NUM2HEX(SERIAL_DATE_NUMBER) '_' NUM2HEX(RAND)]

**readevents_epochsamples** - *read events or markers of specified channels for a specified epoch*

```
[TIMESTAMPS, DATA] = READEVENTS_EPOCHSAMPLES(SELF, CHANNELTYPE, CHANNEL, EPOCHFILES, T0, T1)
 
   SELF is the NDI_DAQSYSTEM_MFDAQ_STIMULUS_VHVISSPIKE2 object.
 
   CHANNELTYPE is a cell array of strings describing the the type(s) of channel(s) to read
   ('event','marker', etc)
   
   CHANNEL is a vector with the identity of the channel(s) to be read.
   
   EPOCH is the cell array of file names associated with an epoch
 
   DATA is a two-column vector; the first column has the time of the event. The second
   column indicates the marker code. In the case of 'events', this is just 1. If more than one channel
   is requested, DATA is returned as a cell array, one entry per channel.
