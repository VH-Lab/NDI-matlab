**addepoch** - *add an epoch to the ndi.element*

```
[NDI_ELEMENT_OBJ, EPOCHDOC] = ADDEPOCH(NDI_ELEMENT_TIMESERIES_OBJ, EPOCHID, EPOCHCLOCK, T0_T1, TIMEPOINTS, DATAPOINTS)
 
  Registers the data for an epoch with the NDI_ELEMENT_OBJ.
 
  Inputs:
    NDI_ELEMENT_OBJ: The ndi.element object to modify
    EPOCHID:       The name of the epoch to add; should match the name of an epoch from the probe
    EPOCHCLOCK:    The epoch clock; must be a single clock type that matches one of the clock types
                      of the probe
    T0_T1:         The starting time and ending time of the existence of information about the ELEMENT on
                      the probe, in units of the epock clock
    TIMEPOINTS:    the time points to be added to this epoch; can also be the string 'probe' which means the
                      points are read directly from the probe (must be Tx1). Timepoints must be in the units
                      of the EPOCHCLOCK.
    DATAPOINTS:    the data points that accompany each timepoint (must be TxXxY...), or can be 'probe' to
                      read from the probe
  Outputs:
     If a second output is requested in EPOCHDOC, then the DOC is NOT added to the database
```

**buildepochgraph** - *compute the epochgraph among epochs for an ndi.epoch.epochset object*

```
[COST,MAPPING] = BUILDEPOCHGRAPH(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ)
 
  Compute the cost and the mapping among epochs in the EPOCHTABLE for an ndi.epoch.epochset object
 
  COST is an MxM matrix where M is the number of EPOCHNODES.
  For example, if there is one epoch with clock types 'dev_local_time' and 'utc', then M is 2.
  Each entry COST(i,j) indicates whether there is a mapping between (epoch, clocktype) i to j.
  The cost of each transformation is normally 1 operation. 
  MAPPING is the ndi.time.timemapping object that describes the mapping.
 
  In the abstract class, the following NDI_CLOCKTYPEs, if they exist, are linked across epochs with 
  a cost of 1 and a linear mapping rule with shift 1 and offset 0:
    'utc' -> 'utc'
    'utc' -> 'approx_utc'
    'exp_global_time' -> 'exp_global_time'
    'exp_global_time' -> 'approx_exp_global_time'
    'dev_global_time' -> 'dev_global_time'
    'dev_global_time' -> 'approx_dev_global_time'

                            |   This uniquely specifies the epoch (with the session id).
  'epoch_session_id'           | Session of the epoch
  'epochprobemap'           | The epochprobemap object from each epoch
  'epoch_clock'             | A cell array of ndi.time.clocktype objects that describe the type of clocks available
  't0_t1'                   | A cell array of ordered pairs [t0 t1] that indicates, for each ndi.time.clocktype, the start and stop
                            |   time of this epoch. The time units of t0_t1{i} match epoch_clock{i}.

```
[COST,MAPPING] = CACHED_EPOCHGRAPH(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ)
 
  Return the cached version of the epoch graph, if it exists and is up-to-date
  (that is, the hash number from the EPOCHTABLE of NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ 
  has not changed). If there is no cached version, or if it is not up-to-date,
  COST and MAPPING will be empty. If the cached epochgraph is present and not up-to-date,
  it is deleted.

**epoch2str** - *convert an epoch number or id to a string*

```
S = EPOCH2STR(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, NUMBER)
 
  Returns the epoch NUMBER in the form of a string. If it is a simple

---

**epochgraph** - *graph of the mapping and cost of converting time among epochs*

```
[COST, MAPPING] = EPOCHGRAPH(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ)
 
  Compute the cost and the mapping among epochs in the EPOCHTABLE for an ndi.epoch.epochset object
 
  COST is an MxM matrix where M is the number of ordered pairs of (epochs, clocktypes).
  For example, if there is one epoch with clock types 'dev_local_time' and 'utc', then M is 2.
  Each entry COST(i,j) indicates whether there is a mapping between (epoch, clocktype) i to j.
  The cost of each transformation is normally 1 operation. 
  MAPPING is the ndi.time.timemapping object that describes the mapping.

---

**epochid** - *Get the epoch identifier for a particular epoch*

```
ID = EPOCHID (NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, EPOCH_NUMBER)
 
  Returns the epoch identifier string for the epoch EPOCH_NUMBER.
  If it doesn't exist, it should be created. EPOCH_NUMBER can be
  a number of an EPOCH ID string.
 
  The abstract class just queries the EPOCHTABLE.
  Most classes that manage epochs themselves (ndi.file.navigator,
  ndi.daq.system) will override this method.

---

**epochnodes** - *return all epoch nodes from an ndi.epoch.epochset object*

```
[NODES,UNDERLYINGNODES] = EPOCHNODES(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ)
 
  Return all EPOCHNODES for an ndi.epoch.epochset. EPOCHNODES consist of the
  following fields:
  Fieldname:                | Description
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  'epoch_id'                | The epoch ID code (will never change once established, though it may be deleted.)
                            |   This epoch ID uniquely specifies the epoch within the session.
  'epoch_session_id'           | The ID of the session that contains the epoch
  'epochprobemap'           | Any contents information for each epoch, usually of type ndi.epoch.epochprobemap or empty.
  'epoch_clock'             | A SINGLE ndi.time.clocktype entry that describes the clock type of this node.
  't0_t1'                   | The times [t0 t1] of the beginning and end of the epoch in units of 'epoch_clock'

                            |   It contains fields 'underlying', 'epoch_id', and 'epochprobemap'
  'objectname'              | A string containing the 'name' field of NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, if it exists. If there is no
                            |   'name' field, then 'unknown' is used.
  'objectclass'             | The object class name of the NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ.
 
  EPOCHNODES are related to EPOCHTABLE entries, except 
     a) only 1 ndi.time.clocktype is permitted per epoch node. If an entry in epoch table contains
        multiple ndi.time.clocktype entries, then each one will have its own epoch node. This aids
        in the construction of the EPOCHGRAPH that helps the system map time from one epoch to another.
     b) EPOCHNODES contain identifying information (objectname and objectclass) to help
        in identifying the epoch nodes across ndi.epoch.epochset objects. 
 
  UNDERLYINGNODES are nodes that are directly linked to this ndi.epoch.epochset's node via 'underlying' epochs.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  'epoch_number'            | The number of the epoch. The number may change as epochs are added and subtracted.

   T0, T1, or it can be a single number, which will indicate the data are to be read from that
   epoch.
