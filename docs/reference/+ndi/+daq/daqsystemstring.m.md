# CLASS ndi.daq.daqsystemstring

```
  NDI_DAQSYSTEMSTRING - a class for describing the device and channels that correspond to an NDI_EPOCHPROBEMAP_DAQSYSTEM
 
   ndi.daq.daqsystemstring
 
   A 'devicestring' is a part of an ndi.epoch.epochprobemap_daqsystem that indicates the channel types and
   channel numbers that correspond to a particular record.
 
   For example, one may specify that a 4-channel extracellular recording with name
   'ctx' and reference 1 was recorded on a device called 'mydevice' via analog input
   on channels 27-28 and 45 and 88 with the following ndi.epoch.epochprobemap_daqsystem entry:
            name: 'ctx'
       reference: 1
            type: 'extracellular_electrode-4'
    devicestring: 'mydevice:ai27-28,45,88
 
   The form of a device string is DEVICENAME:CT####, where DEVICENAME is the name of 
   ndi.daq.system object, CT is the channel type identifier, and #### is a list of channels.
   The #### list of channels should be numbered from 1, and can use the symbols '-' to
   indicate a sequential run of channels, and ',' to separate channels.
   Use a semicolon to separate channel types (e.g., 'ai27-28;di1')
   
   For example:
      '1-5,10,17'      corresponds to [1 2 3 4 5 10 17]
      '2,5,11-12,8     corresponds to [2 5 11 12 8]
      ''               corresponds to []  % if the device doesn't have channels

**daqsystemstring** - *Create an NDI_DEVICESTRING object from a string or from a device name, channel type, and channel list*

```
DEVSTR = ndi.daq.daqsystemstring(DEVICENAME, CHANNELTYPE, CHANNELLIST)
     or DEVSTR = ndi.daq.daqsystemstring(DEVSTRING)
 
  Creates a device string suitable for a ndi.epoch.epochprobemap_daqsystem from a DEVICENAME,
  a cell array of strings CHANNELTYPE (such as 'ai', 'di', 'ao'), and a CHANNELLIST.
 
  Inputs:
     In the first form:
       DEVICENAME should be the name of an ndi.daq.system
       CHANNEL_PREFIX should be the prefix for a particular type of channel. These channel type will vary from
           device to device. For example, a NDI_DAQSYSTEM_MULTICHANNELDAQ might use:
             'ai' - analog input
             'ao' - analog output (it is an 'o' like 'oh', not 0)
             'di' - digital input
             'do' - digital output
       CHANNELLIST should be an array of channel numbers, which must start from 1 (that is,
             the first channel is 1).
     In the second form:
       DEVSTRING should be in the form: 'devicename:ct#,#-#,#,#'
         where devicename is the name of the device, ct is a string that corresponds to the channel type, and
         the numbers and separators specify the channel numbers to be accessed.
 
  Examples:
 
       myndi_daqsystemstring1 = ndi_devicestring('mydevice','ai',[1:5 7 23])
       myndi_daqsystemstring2 = ndi_devicestring('mydevice:ai1-5,7,23');

**devicestring** - *Produce an ndi.daq.daqsystemstring character string*

```
DEVSTR = DEVICESTRING(SELF)
 
  Creates a device string suitable for a ndi.epoch.epochprobemap_daqsystem from an ndi.daq.daqsystemstring object.
 
  Inputs:
     SELF - an ndi.daq.daqsystemstring object
  Outputs:
     DEVSTR - the device string; e.g., 'mydevice:ai1-5,10,11-23'

**ndi_daqsystemstring2channel** - *Convert an ndi.daq.daqsystemstring to device, channel type, channel list*

```
[DEVICENAME, CHANNELTYPE, CHANNELLIST] = NDI_DAQSYSTEMSTRING2CHANNEL(SELF, DEVSTR)
 
  Returns the device name (DEVICENAME), channel type (CHANNELTYPE), and channel list
  (CHANNEL) of a device string.
 
  Inputs:
     DEVSTR should be an NDI devicestring in the form: devicename:ct#,#-#,#,#
  Outputs:
     DEVICENAME is the string corresponding to the device name
     CHANNELTYPE is a cell array of strings with channel types
     CHANNELLIST is an array of the channel numbers
 
  Example:
     devstr = ndi.daq.daqsystemstring('mydevice:ai1-5,13,18');
     [devicename, channeltype, channel] = ndi_daqsystemstring2channel(devstr);
     % devicename == 'mydevice', channelype = 'ai', channel == [1 2 3 4 5 13 18]
