**does_subjectstring_match_session_document** - *does a subject string match a document?*

```
[B, SUBJECT_ID] = DOES_SUBJECTSTRING_MATCH_SESSION_DOCUMENT(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, ...
     SUBJECTSTRING, MAKEIT)
 
  Given a SUBJECTSTRING, which is either the local identifier for a subject in the
  ndi.session object, or a document ID in the database, determine if the SUBJECTSTRING
  corresponds to an ndi.document already in the database. If so, then the ID of that document
  is returned in SUBJECT_ID and B is 1. If it is not there, and if MAKEIT is 1, then
  a new entry is made and the document id is returned in SUBJECT_ID. If MAKEIT is 0, and it is
  not there, then B is 0 and SUBJECT_ID is empty.

  UTC Leap Seconds time. The serial date number is the number of days since January 0, 0000 at 0:00:00.
  The integer portion of the date is the whole number of days and the fractional part of the date number
  is the fraction of days.
 
  ID = [NUM2HEX(SERIAL_DATE_NUMBER) '_' NUM2HEX(RAND)]
