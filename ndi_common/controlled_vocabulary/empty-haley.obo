name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: lawn OD600
def: "The target or nominal optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the bacterial food patch encountered by the C. elegans worm. This indicates the initial concentration of bacteria in that patch."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: bacterial lawn growth condition
def: "A descriptive label detailing the specific conditions under which the bacterial lawn on the assay plate was grown, which influences its density and characteristics (e.g., '1 hour', '12 hours', '48 hours')."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: bacterial lawn growth duration
def: "The total duration, typically in hours, for which the bacterial lawn was allowed to grow on the assay plate at room temperature after seeding and before experimental use or cold storage. This directly affects patch density."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: on-patch velocity (average)
def: "The average velocity of the C. elegans worm while it is located *on* a bacterial food patch during an encounter. This is a key indicator for distinguishing different behavioral states like searching, sampling, or exploiting."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: on-patch velocity (minimum)
def: "The minimum instantaneous velocity recorded for the C. elegans worm while it is located *on* a bacterial food patch during an encounter. This metric helps in classifying encounters as 'sensing' or 'non-responding' based on observed slowdown."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: maximum on-patch distance from edge
def: "The maximum distance, in millimeters, that the worm's midpoint reached from the patch edge *while technically being on the patch* during an encounter. This helps refine the definition of an 'on-patch' event and exclude 'near miss' encounters. This refers to scenarios where the animal's head is on the patch but its midpoint is slightly further away."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: pre-entry velocity (peak)
def: "The peak instantaneous velocity of the C. elegans worm observed immediately *before* its entry into a bacterial food patch. This is used in conjunction with `velocityAfterEnter` and `velocityOnMin` to calculate deceleration and characterize the sensing response."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: post-entry velocity
def: "The instantaneous velocity of the C. elegans worm observed immediately *after* its entry into a bacterial food patch. This helps quantify the immediate change in speed upon encountering food."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: slowdown time
def: "The specific time point, relative to patch entry, at which the C. elegans worm significantly decelerates upon encountering a bacterial food patch. This indicates a sensory response to the food presence."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: deceleration upon encounter
def: "The rate of change in the C. elegans worm's velocity, measured as the slope of the velocity curve during a defined time window surrounding its encounter with a bacterial patch. A negative value indicates a slowdown upon encounter. Unit: µm/s²."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: off-patch velocity (average)
def: "The average velocity of the C. elegans worm while it is located *off* a bacterial food patch. This serves as a baseline for comparison with on-patch velocities and indicates searching behavior."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: maximum off-patch distance from edge
def: "The maximum distance, in millimeters, that the worm's midpoint reached from the patch edge *while technically being off the patch* during an off-patch event. This is used to distinguish true leaving events from temporary excursions or specific postures where the midpoint briefly appears outside the patch."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: entry censorship flag
def: "A boolean flag indicating whether the beginning of a patch encounter was *not* fully observed or recorded (i.e., the animal was already on a patch when the recording started), leading to left-censored duration data."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: exit censorship flag
def: "A boolean flag indicating whether the end of a patch encounter was *not* fully observed or recorded (i.e., the animal was still on a patch when the recording ended), leading to right-censored duration data."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: experiment type
def: "A descriptive name for the overall experimental paradigm or type of foraging assay being conducted (e.g., 'foragingConcentration', 'foragingMini')."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: peptone presence
def: "Indicates whether peptone was included in the Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar for the assay plates. Peptone presence can affect bacterial growth on assay patches. Typically 'with' or 'without'."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: bacterial OD600 label
def: "A string label used to categorize or identify the nominal OD600 condition of the food patches in a C. elegans experiment (e.g., '1.0', '0.5', '10.0') corresponding to the relative density conditions."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: bacterial lawn volume
def: "The volume of bacterial solution pipetted to create each individual food patch on the C. elegans assay plate. Unit: microliters (µL)."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: worm cultivation growth duration
def: "The total duration for which the bacterial lawn was allowed to grow on the C. elegans cultivation plates starting at the time seeded and ending when the worms were picked (i.e. placed on the plate). Unit: hours or days."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: worm age at assay (growth duration)
def: "The total duration of C. elegans development from the L4 larval stage (at picking) to their age or developmental stage at the time of the assay. Unit: hours."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: bacterial patch fluorescent border amplitude
def: "A quantitative measure of bacterial density at the edge of a food patch, derived from fluorescence imaging, defined as the difference in magnitude between the peak pixel intensity at the patch edge and the intensity at the border. This serves as an estimate of the perceived bacterial density."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: bacterial patch fluorescent border amplitude (growth adjusted)
def: "The estimated bacterial patch fluorescent border amplitude value adjusted for the total time the bacterial patch was allowed to grow, normalizing for growth effects to provide a more consistent measure of initial or effective bacterial density."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: exploitation probability (posterior)
def: "The posterior probability, derived from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classification, that a given patch encounter represents an 'exploitation' event (i.e., the worm has accepted the patch and is consuming bacteria). This value ranges from 0 to 1."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: sensing probability (posterior)
def: "The posterior probability, derived from a semi-supervised Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), that a given patch encounter was 'sensed' by the C. elegans worm (i.e., the animal detected the presence of bacteria, typically indicated by a slowdown). This value ranges from 0 to 1."

name: C. elegans Behavioral Assay: encounter behavioral label
def: "A categorical classification of the behavioral state during a patch encounter, combining the 'explore/exploit' and 'sensing/non-responding' classifications. Possible labels include 'search' (non-responding on-patch behavior), 'sample' (sensing but rejecting the patch), and 'exploit' (sensing and accepting the patch)."
