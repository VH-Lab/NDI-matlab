The NDI system includes pieces of code called ndi.daq.reader objects which interpret data recorded with different acquisition devices. Each ndi.daq.reader is specific to a particular device, and ndi.daq.reader objects already exist for devices by several neuroscience software manufacturers. Q: Can I use NDI if my lab builds our own devices and measuring tools? \u00b6 A : Yes. You will need to write one piece of code - an ndi.daq.reader object - for each original DAQ system you use. Possibly, you will also need to create an `ndi.daq.metadatareader to read metadata, such as stimulus information for custom stimuli. Once these are created, your data can be read and analyzed with NDI. Q: Do I need to change the way my lab organizes our data files in order to use NDI? \u00b6 A : No - the NDI system is able to retrieve data files organized in any way. NDI uses pieces of code called ndi.file.navigator objects to locate data from a recording epoch. Each ndi.file.navigator works within a specific organization system, and you can specify the parameters to cause the file navigator to navigate your lab's system. Q: Can I use NDI to pool data from multiple labs? \u00b6 A : Yes. Once each lab has an ndi.daq.system that consists of an ndi.file.navigator that can locate files within its storage system and ndi.daq.reader objects for each their data acquisition systems, NDI can read and analyze datasets from both labs together.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#ndi-frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"NDI Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#q-can-i-use-ndi-to-analyze-data-recorded-in-any-format","text":"A : Yes.

Its goals include: Providing a means for specifying and accessing neuroscience data regardless of the format of the files or the organization of the files and data on disk or in the cloud. Allowing the creation of analysis code that is invariant to data format and organization, so the analysis process can be independent of the raw format. Providing a database for storing human- and machine-readable documents that describe analyses, analyses of analyses, etc, that is searchable with or without knowing the formal schema of the documents of interest. Allowing the creation of an application ecosystem where individual applications can read raw data and read from the database, and write results back to the database to participate in analysis pipelines. Eliminating the need for different procedures between online and offline analyses. Maintaining a ready-to-share version of the analysis pipeline at all times, so data can be shared with other groups or archives without additional work.

Documentation is at https://vh-lab.github.io/NDI-matlab/ Still in early development Description of key terms: \u00b6 session : A collection of measurements and analysis that are associated with one experimental session. A \"study\" usually consists of several sessions. probe : An instrument that makes a measurement or provides stimulation. Examples include an electrode, a camera, a 2-photon microscope, a visual stimulus monitor, a nose-poke, a feeder. iodvice : An instrument that digitally acquires and stores measurement values or controls a stimulator. epoch : An episode of time during which data from an iodevice is acquired. Each epoch consists of an interval of time between when a data acquisition device was switched on to acquire data and when it was switched off. An epoch on one device may or may not correspond to epochs from other devices, and synchronization can be managed by NDI_SYNCGRAPH. Description of software objects that impliment the framework: \u00b6 ndi_session : The class that implements the basic structure of an experiment, including an iodevice list, synggraph, cache, reference, and a unique reference string. ndi_session_dir : A session that uses the file system for storage of its parameters and database. This is presently used for all experiments. ndi_iodevice : A software object that reads data from files created by hardware data acquisition devices ndi_filetree : A file organizing class that traverses any file structure to identify the data files associated with each epoch Required device metadata: Classes (consisting of ndi_iodevicestring and ndi_epochcontents ) that describe the probes and channel mappings between the probes and the iodevice objects. Database objects: ndi_database : A (mostly) abstract database object that specifies the API for storing and searching documents ndi_document : An extensible database document object class that has a name, a unique identifier, and fields that are described in .JSON files. ndi_binarydoc : An abstract class that allows binary reading/writing from files associated with ndi_document . Specific implementations can write to a local file system, or a remote file system such as GRID-FS, etc. Implementations: Because ndi_database lacks specific implementation of key methods, one needs to use an implementation. Right now we have the following: ndi_matlabdumbjsondb : A Matlab implementation of a very simple database ( dumbjsondb in https://github.com/VH-Lab/vhlab-toolbox-matlab) ndi_binarydoc_matfid : A Matlab implementation for reading/writing files that are on the machine's filesystem Timing objects ndi_clocktype : Types of clocks (such as UTC, local, global, global experiment) ndi_timemapping : a mapping between epochs and iodevices ndi_syncgraph : an object that finds mappings from one device and epoch to another using all known timing relationships among iodevices ndi_syncrule : A rule for describing the relationship between data collected on different iodevices ndi_syncrule_filematch : A rule that describes a timing relationship as \"equal\" if two epochs contain raw data files in common Tutorials \u00b6 For developers: A tour of ndi_documents and ndi_database: https://github.com/VH-Lab/NDI-matlab/blob/master/demo/documents_database/document_database_demo.ipynb For developers: A tour of epochs, daqsystems, probes, and things: https://github.com/VH-Lab/NDI-matlab/blob/master/demo/epochs_daqsystems_probes_things/epochdemo1.ipynb Conventions \u00b6 Channels, samples, and other quantities are numbered from 1..N Development conventions \u00b6 Documentation of classes should follow the Matlab standard: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-help-for-classes.html In input arguments and documentation, we'll use \"indexes\" instead of \"indices\" and try to keep other English language exceptions to a minimum All error messages should be informative and give specific information about the problem, not just say 'an error occurred.' Most of the time, class names should include the full parentage of the object, starting with the basic classes for NDI: ndi_session, ndi_iodevice, ndi_probe. For example, a class implementing device drivers for a multifunction data aquisition board from mycompany should be called ndi_iodevice_mfdaq_mycompany to indicate that the object is descended from the ndi_iodevice and ndi_iodevice_mfdaq objects. Let's make exceptions if putting the full parentage gets cumbersome without adding clarity. Most users and programmers don't need to think about those classes (but will need to think about the basic classes ndi_session , ndi_database , and ndi_iodevice ).

If it doesn't exist, it should be created. EPOCH_NUMBER can be a number of an EPOCH ID string. The abstract class just queries the EPOCHTABLE. Most classes that manage epochs themselves (ndi.file.navigator, ndi.daq.system) will override this method. Help for ndi.element/epochid is inherited from superclass NDI.EPOCH.EPOCHSET epochnodes - return all epoch nodes from an ndi.epoch.epochset object [NODES,UNDERLYINGNODES] = EPOCHNODES(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) Return all EPOCHNODES for an ndi.epoch.epochset.

If there is no | 'name' field, then 'unknown' is used. 'objectclass' | The object class name of the NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ. EPOCHNODES are related to EPOCHTABLE entries, except a) only 1 ndi.time.clocktype is permitted per epoch node. If an entry in epoch table contains multiple ndi.time.clocktype entries, then each one will have its own epoch node. This aids in the construction of the EPOCHGRAPH that helps the system map time from one epoch to another. b) EPOCHNODES contain identifying information (objectname and objectclass) to help in identifying the epoch nodes across ndi.epoch.epochset objects. UNDERLYINGNODES are nodes that are directly linked to this ndi.epoch.epochset's node via 'underlying' epochs. Help for ndi.element/epochnodes is inherited from superclass NDI.EPOCH.EPOCHSET epochsetname - the name of the ndi.element object, for EPOCHNODES NAME = EPOCHSETNAME(NDI_ELEMENT_OBJ) Returns the object name that is used when creating epoch nodes.

The time units of t0_t1{i} match epoch_clock{i}. 'underlying_epochs' | A structure array of the ndi.epoch.epochset objects that comprise these epochs. | It contains fields 'underlying', 'epoch_number', 'epoch_id', and 'epochprobemap' HASHVALUE is the hashed value of the epochtable.

Be sure you mean it! daqsystem_load - Load daqsystem objects from an ndi.session DEV = DAQSYSTEM_LOAD(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, PARAM1, VALUE1, PARAM2, VALUE2, ...) or DEV = DAQSYSTEM_LOAD(NDI_SESSION_OBJ) Returns the ndi.daq.system objects in the ndi.session with metadata parameters PARAMS1 that matches VALUE1, PARAMS2 that matches VALUE2, etc. One can also search for 'name' as a parameter; this will be automatically changed to search for database documents with fields 'ndi_document.name' equal to the corresponding value. If more than one object is requested, then DEV will be a cell list of matching objects. Otherwise, the object will be a single element. If there are no matches, empty ([]) is returned. daqsystem_rm - Remove a sampling device from an ndi.session object NDI_SESSION_OBJ = DAQSYSTEM_RM(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, DEV) Removes the device DEV from the device list. See also: DAQSYSTEM_ADD, ndi.session database_add - Add an ndi.document to an ndi.session object NDI_SESSION_OBJ = DATABASE_ADD(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, NDI_DOCUMENT_OBJ) Adds the ndi.document NDI_DOCUMENT_OBJ to the ndi.session NDI_SESSION_OBJ. NDI_DOCUMENT_OBJ can also be a cell array of ndi.document objects, which will all be added in turn. The database can be queried by calling NDI_SESSION_OBJ/SEARCH See also: DATABASE_RM, ndi.session, ndi.database, ndi.session/SEARCH database_clear - deletes/removes all entries from the database associated with an session DATABASE_CLEAR(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, AREYOUSURE) Removes all documents from the NDI_SESSION_OBJ object.

Otherwise, it will not. database_closebinarydoc - close and unlock an ndi.database.binarydoc [NDI_BINARYDOC_OBJ] = DATABASE_CLOSEBINARYDOC(NDI_DATABASE_OBJ, NDI_BINARYDOC_OBJ) Close and lock an NDI_BINARYDOC_OBJ. The NDI_BINARYDOC_OBJ must be unlocked in the database, which is why it is necessary to call this function through the session object. database_openbinarydoc - open the ndi.database.binarydoc channel of an ndi.document NDI_BINARYDOC_OBJ = DATABASE_OPENBINARYDOC(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, NDI_DOCUMENT_OR_ID) Return the open ndi . database . binarydoc object that corresponds to an ndi . document and NDI_DOCUMENT_OR_ID can be either the document id of an ndi . document or an ndi . document object itsef . Note that this NDI_BINARYDOC_OBJ must be closed and unlocked with ndi.session/CLOSEBINARYDOC. The locked nature of the binary doc is a property of the database, not the document, which is why the database is needed in the method. database_rm - Remove an ndi.document with a given document ID from an ndi.session object NDI_SESSION_OBJ = DATABASE_RM(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, DOC_UNIQUE_ID) or NDI_SESSION_OBJ = DATABASE_RM(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, DOC) Removes an ndi.document with document id DOC_UNIQUE_ID from the NDI_SESSION_OBJ.database. In the second form, if an ndi.document or cell array of NDI_DOCUMENTS is passed for DOC, then the document unique ids are retrieved and they are removed in turn. If DOC/DOC_UNIQUE_ID is empty, no action is taken. This function also takes parameters as name/value pairs that modify its behavior: Parameter (default) | Description ErrIfNotFound (0) | Produce an error if an ID to be deleted is not found.

If no object is found, OBJ will be empty ([]). findobj - FINDOBJ Find objects matching specified conditions. The FINDOBJ method of the HANDLE class follows the same syntax as the MATLAB FINDOBJ command, except that the first argument must be an array of handles to objects. HM = FINDOBJ(H, <conditions>) searches the handle object array H and returns an array of handle objects matching the specified conditions.

Examines all the database of NDI_SESSION_OBJ and returns all ndi.element entries. ELEMENTS is a cell array of ndi.element.* objects. ELEMENTS = GETELEMENTS(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, 'PROP1', VALUE1, 'PROP2', VALUE2...) returns only those probes for which 'PROP1' has a value of VALUE1, 'PROP2' has a value of VALUE2, etc. Properties of elements are 'element.name', 'element.type', 'element.direct', and 'probe.name', 'probe.type', and 'probe.reference'. getpath - Return the path of the session P = GETPATH(NDI_SESSION_OBJ) Returns the path of an ndi.session object. The path is some sort of reference to the storage location of the session. This might be a URL, or a file directory, depending upon the subclass. In the ndi.session class, this returns empty. See also: ndi.session getprobes - Return all NDI_PROBES that are found in ndi.daq.system epoch contents entries PROBES = GETPROBES(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, ...) Examines all ndi.daq.system entries in the NDI_SESSION_OBJ's device array and returns all ndi.probe.* entries that can be constructed from each device's ndi.epoch.epochprobemap entries. PROBES is a cell array of ndi.probe.* objects. One can pass additional arguments that specify the classnames of the probes that are returned: PROBES = GETPROBES(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, CLASSMATCH ) only probes that are members of the classes CLASSMATCH etc., are returned. PROBES = GETPROBES(NDI_SESSION_OBJ, 'PROP1', VALUE1, 'PROP2', VALUE2...) returns only those probes for which 'PROP1' has a value of VALUE1, 'PROP2' has a value of VALUE2, etc. Properties of probes are 'name', 'reference', and 'type', and 'subject_ID'. gt - > (GT) Greater than relation for handles.

TF = ISVALID(H) performs an element-wise check for validity on the handle elements of H. The result is a logical array of the same dimensions as H, where each element is the element-wise validity result. A handle is invalid if it has been deleted or if it is an element of a handle array and has not yet been initialized . See also NDI . SESSION , NDI . SESSION / DELETE Help for ndi.session/isvalid is inherited from superclass HANDLE Documentation for ndi . session / isvalid doc handle . isvalid le - <= (LE) Less than or equal relation for handles. Handles are equal if they are handles for the same object. All comparisons use a number associated with each handle object. Nothing can be assumed about the result of a handle comparison except that the repeated comparison of two handles in the same MATLAB session will yield the same result. The order of handle values is purely arbitrary and has no connection to the state of the handle objects being compared. H1 <= H2 performs element - wise comparisons between handle arrays H1 and H2 . H1 and H2 must be of the same dimensions unless one is a scalar . The result is a logical array of the same dimensions , where each element is an element - wise >= result .

LISTENER does not bind the listener 's lifecycle to the object that is the source of the event . Destroying the source object does not impact the lifecycle of the listener object . A listener created with LISTENER must be destroyed independently of the source object . Calling delete ( el ) explicitly destroys the listener . Redefining or clearing the variable containing the listener can delete the listener if no other references to it exist .

FID = FOPEN(FILENAME) opens the file FILENAME for read access. FILENAME is the name of the file to be opened. FILENAME can be a MATLABPATH relative partial pathname . If the file is not found in the current working directory , FOPEN searches for it on the MATLAB search path . On UNIX systems , FILENAME may also start with a \"~/\" or a \"~username/\" , which FOPEN expands to the current user ' s home directory or the specified user ' s home directory , respectively . FID is a scalar MATLAB integer valued double , called a file identifier . You use FID as the first argument to other file input / output routines , such as FREAD and FCLOSE . If FOPEN cannot open the file , it returns - 1. FID = FOPEN ( FILENAME , PERMISSION ) opens the file FILENAME in the mode specified by PERMISSION: 'r' open file for reading 'w' open file for writing ; discard existing contents 'a' open or create file for writing ; append data to end of file ' r + ' open ( do not create ) file for reading and writing ' w + ' open or create file for reading and writing ; discard existing contents ' a + ' open or create file for reading and writing ; append data to end of file 'W' open file for writing without automatic flushing 'A' open file for appending without automatic flushing FILENAME can be a MATLABPATH relative partial pathname only if the file is opened for reading . You can open files in binary mode ( the default ) or in text mode . In binary mode , no characters get singled out for special treatment . In text mode on the PC , the carriage return character preceding a newline character is deleted on input and added before the newline character on output . To open a file in text mode , append 't' to the permission specifier , for example ' rt ' and ' w + t '. ( On Unix , text and binary mode are the same , so this has no effect . On PC systems this is critical .) If the file is opened in update mode ( '+' ), you must use an FSEEK or FREWIND between an input command like FREAD , FSCANF , FGETS , or FGETL and an output command like FWRITE or FPRINTF . You must also use an FSEEK or FREWIND between an output command and an input command . Two file identifiers are automatically available and need not be opened . They are FID = 1 ( standard output ) and FID = 2 ( standard error ). [ FID , MESSAGE ] = FOPEN ( FILENAME ,...) returns a system dependent error message if the open is not successful . [ FID , MESSAGE ] = FOPEN ( FILENAME , PERMISSION , MACHINEFORMAT ) opens the specified file with the specified PERMISSION and treats data read using FREAD or data written using FWRITE as having a format given by MACHINEFORMAT . MACHINEFORMAT is one of the following: ' native ' or 'n' - local machine format - the default ' ieee - le ' or 'l' - IEEE floating point with little - endian byte ordering ' ieee - be ' or 'b' - IEEE floating point with big - endian byte ordering ' ieee - le . l64 ' or 'a' - IEEE floating point with little - endian byte ordering and 64 bit long data type ' ieee - be . l64 ' or 's' - IEEE floating point with big - endian byte ordering and 64 bit long data type . [ FID , MESSAGE ] = FOPEN ( FILENAME , PERMISSION , MACHINEFORMAT , ENCODING ) opens the specified file using the specified PERMISSION and MACHINEFORMAT . ENCODING specifies the name of a character encoding scheme associated with the file . It must be the empty character vector (''), empty string ( \"\" ), or a name , or alias for an encoding scheme . Some examples are ' UTF - 8 ', ' latin1 ', ' US - ASCII ', and ' Shift_JIS '. For common names and aliases , see the Web site http: //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. If ENCODING is unspecified , or is the empty character vector (''), or is the empty string ( \"\" ), MATLAB ' s default encoding scheme is used . [ FILENAME , PERMISSION , MACHINEFORMAT , ENCODING ] = FOPEN ( FID ) returns the filename , permission , machine format , and character encoding values used by MATLAB when it opened the file associated with identifier FID . MATLAB does not determine these output values by reading information from the opened file . For any of these parameters that were not specified when the file was opened , MATLAB returns its default value . The ENCODING is a standard character encoding scheme name that may not be the same as the ENCODING argument used in the call to FOPEN that opened the file . An invalid FID returns empty character vector ('') for all output arguments . FIDS = FOPEN (' all ') returns a row vector containing the file identifiers for all the files currently opened by the user ( but not 1 or 2 ). The 'W' and 'A' permissions do not automatically perform a flush of the current output buffer after output operations . See also FCLOSE , FERROR , FGETL , FGETS , FPRINTF , FREAD , FSCANF , FSEEK , FTELL , FWRITE . fread - FREAD Read binary data from file. A = FREAD(FID) reads binary data from the specified file and writes it into matrix A. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN. MATLAB reads the entire file and positions the file pointer at the end of the file (see FEOF for details). A = FREAD ( FID , SIZE ) reads the number of elements specified by SIZE . Valid entries for SIZE are : N read N elements into a column vector . inf read to the end of the file . [ M , N ] read elements to fill an M-by-N matrix , in column order . N can be inf , but M can 't. A = FREAD(FID,SIZE,PRECISION) reads the file according to the data format specified by PRECISION. The PRECISION input commonly contains a datatype specifier like ' int ' or ' float ', followed by an integer giving the size in bits. The SIZE argument is optional when using this syntax. Any of the following values, either the MATLAB version, or their C or Fortran equivalent, may be used for PRECISION. If not specified, the default PRECISION is ' uint8 '. MATLAB C or Fortran Description ' uchar ' ' unsigned char ' unsigned integer, 8 bits. ' schar ' ' signed char ' signed integer, 8 bits. ' int8 ' ' integer * 1 ' integer, 8 bits. ' int16 ' ' integer * 2 ' integer, 16 bits. ' int32 ' ' integer * 4 ' integer, 32 bits. ' int64 ' ' integer * 8 ' integer, 64 bits. ' uint8 ' ' integer * 1 ' unsigned integer, 8 bits. ' uint16 ' ' integer * 2 ' unsigned integer, 16 bits. ' uint32 ' ' integer * 4 ' unsigned integer, 32 bits. ' uint64 ' ' integer * 8 ' unsigned integer, 64 bits. ' single ' ' real * 4 ' floating point, 32 bits. ' float32 ' ' real * 4 ' floating point, 32 bits. ' double ' ' real * 8 ' floating point, 64 bits. ' float64 ' ' real * 8 ' floating point, 64 bits. The following platform dependent formats are also supported but they are not guaranteed to be the same size on all platforms. MATLAB C or Fortran Description ' char ' ' char * 1 ' character. ' short ' ' short ' integer, 16 bits. ' int ' ' int ' integer, 32 bits. ' long ' ' long ' integer, 32 or 64 bits. ' ushort ' ' unsigned short ' unsigned integer, 16 bits. ' uint ' ' unsigned int ' unsigned integer, 32 bits. ' ulong ' ' unsigned long ' unsigned integer, 32 bits or 64 bits. ' float ' ' float ' floating point, 32 bits. If the precision is ' char ' or ' char * 1 ', MATLAB reads characters using the encoding scheme associated with the file. See FOPEN for more information. The following formats map to an input stream of bits rather than bytes. ' bitN ' signed integer, N bits (1<=N<=64). ' ubitN ' unsigned integer, N bits (1<=N<=64). If the input stream is bytes and FREAD reaches the end of file (see FEOF) in the middle of reading the number of bytes required for an element, the partial result is ignored. However, if the input stream is bits, then the partial result is returned as the last value. If an error occurs before reaching the end of file, only full elements read up to that point are used. By default, numeric and character values are returned in class ' double ' arrays. To return these values stored in classes other than double, create your PRECISION argument by first specifying your source format, then following it by ' => ', and finally specifying your destination format. If the source and destination formats are the same then the following shorthand notation may be used: *source which means: source=>source For example, uint8=>uint8 read in unsigned 8-bit integers and save them in an unsigned 8-bit integer array *uint8 shorthand version of previous example bit4=>int8 read in signed 4-bit integers packed in bytes and save them in a signed 8-bit integer array (each 4-bit integer becomes one 8-bit integer) double=>real*4 read in doubles, convert and save as a 32-bit floating point array A = FREAD(FID,SIZE,PRECISION,SKIP) includes a SKIP argument that specifies the number of bytes to skip after each PRECISION value is read. If PRECISION specifies a bit source format, like ' bitN ' or ' ubitN ', the SKIP argument is interpreted as the number of bits to skip. The SIZE argument is optional when using this syntax. When SKIP is used, the PRECISION specifier may contain a positive integer repetition factor of the form ' N * ' which prepends the source format of the PRECISION argument, like ' 40 * uchar '. Note that 40*uchar for the PRECISION alone is equivalent to ' 40 * uchar => double ', not ' 40 * uchar => uchar '. With SKIP specified, FREAD reads in, at most, a repetition factor number of values (default of 1), does a skip of input specified by the SKIP argument, reads in another block of values and does a skip of input, etc. until SIZE number of values have been read. If a SKIP argument is not specified, the repetition factor is ignored. Repetition with skip is useful for extracting data in noncontiguous fields from fixed length records. For example, s = fread(fid,120,' 40 * uchar => uchar ',8); reads in 120 characters in blocks of 40 each separated by 8 characters. A = FREAD(FID,SIZE,PRECISION,SKIP,MACHINEFORMAT) treats the data read as having a format given by the MACHINEFORMAT. You can obtain the MACHINEFORMAT argument from the output of the FOPEN function. See FOPEN for possible values for MACHINEFORMAT. The SIZE and SKIP arguments are optional when using this syntax. [ A , COUNT ] = FREAD(...) Optional output argument COUNT returns the number of elements successfully read. Examples: The file alphabet.txt contains the 26 letters of the English alphabet, all capitalized. Open the file for read access with fopen, and read the first five elements into output c. Because a precision has not been specified, MATLAB uses the default precision of uchar, and the output is numeric: fid = fopen(' alphabet . txt ', ' r '); c = fread(fid, 5)' c = 65 66 67 68 69 fclose ( fid ); This time , specify that you want each element read as an unsigned 8-bit integer and output as a character . ( Using a precision of 'char=>char' or '*char' will produce the same result ): fid = fopen ( 'alphabet.txt' , 'r' ); c = fread ( fid , 5 , 'uint8=>char' ) ' c = ABCDE fclose ( fid ); See also FWRITE , FSEEK , FSCANF , FGETL , FGETS , LOAD , FOPEN , FEOF . fseek - FSEEK Set file position indicator. STATUS = FSEEK(FID, OFFSET, ORIGIN) repositions the file position indicator in the file associated with the given FID. FSEEK sets the position indicator to the byte with the specified OFFSET relative to ORIGIN. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN . OFFSET values are interpreted as follows : >= 0 Move position indicator OFFSET bytes after ORIGIN . < 0 Move position indicator OFFSET bytes before ORIGIN . ORIGIN values are interpreted as follows : ' bof ' or - 1 Beginning of file ' cof ' or 0 Current position in file ' eof ' or 1 End of file STATUS is 0 on success and - 1 on failure . If an error occurs , use FERROR to get more information . Example : fseek ( fid , 0 , - 1 ) \" rewinds \" the file . See also FERROR , FOPEN , FPRINTF , FREAD , FREWIND , FSCANF , FSEEK , FTELL , FWRITE . ftell - FTELL Get file position indicator. POSITION = FTELL(FID) returns the location of the file position indicator in the specified file. Position is indicated in bytes from the beginning of the file. If -1 is returned, it indicates that the query was unsuccessful. Use FERROR to determine the nature of the error. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN. See also FERROR, FOPEN, FPRINTF, FREAD, FREWIND, FSCANF, FSEEK, FWRITE. fwrite - FWRITE Write binary data to file. COUNT = FWRITE(FID,A) writes the elements of matrix A to the specified file. The data are written in column order. COUNT is the number of elements successfully written. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN , or 1 for standard output or 2 for standard error . COUNT = FWRITE ( FID , A , PRECISION ) writes the elements of matrix A to the specified file , translating MATLAB values to the specified precision . PRECISION controls the form and size of the result . See the list of allowed precisions under FREAD . If PRECISION is not specified , MATLAB uses the default , which is ' uint8 ' . If either ' bitN ' or ' ubitN ' is used for the PRECISION then any out of range value of A is written as a value with all bits turned on . If the precision is ' char ' or ' char*1 ' , MATLAB writes characters using the encoding scheme associated with the file . See FOPEN for more information . COUNT = FWRITE ( FID , A , PRECISION , SKIP ) includes an optional SKIP argument that specifies the number of bytes to skip before each PRECISION value is written . With the SKIP argument present , FWRITE skips and writes a value , skips and writes another value , etc . until all of A is written . If PRECISION is a bit format like ' bitN ' or ' ubitN ' SKIP is specified in bits . This is useful for inserting data into noncontiguous fields in fixed length records . COUNT = FWRITE ( FID , A , PRECISION , SKIP , MACHINEFORMAT ) treats the data written as having a format given by MACHINEFORMAT . You can obtain the MACHINEFORMAT argument from the output of the FOPEN function . See FOPEN for possible values for MACHINEFORMAT . For example , fid = fopen ( ' magic5.bin ' , ' wb ' ) fwrite ( fid , magic ( 5 ) , ' integer*4 ' ) creates a 100 - byte binary file , containing the 25 elements of the 5 - by - 5 magic square , stored as 4 - byte integers .

FID = FOPEN(FILENAME) opens the file FILENAME for read access. FILENAME is the name of the file to be opened. FILENAME can be a MATLABPATH relative partial pathname . If the file is not found in the current working directory , FOPEN searches for it on the MATLAB search path . On UNIX systems , FILENAME may also start with a \"~/\" or a \"~username/\" , which FOPEN expands to the current user ' s home directory or the specified user ' s home directory , respectively . FID is a scalar MATLAB integer valued double , called a file identifier . You use FID as the first argument to other file input / output routines , such as FREAD and FCLOSE . If FOPEN cannot open the file , it returns - 1. FID = FOPEN ( FILENAME , PERMISSION ) opens the file FILENAME in the mode specified by PERMISSION: 'r' open file for reading 'w' open file for writing ; discard existing contents 'a' open or create file for writing ; append data to end of file ' r + ' open ( do not create ) file for reading and writing ' w + ' open or create file for reading and writing ; discard existing contents ' a + ' open or create file for reading and writing ; append data to end of file 'W' open file for writing without automatic flushing 'A' open file for appending without automatic flushing FILENAME can be a MATLABPATH relative partial pathname only if the file is opened for reading . You can open files in binary mode ( the default ) or in text mode . In binary mode , no characters get singled out for special treatment . In text mode on the PC , the carriage return character preceding a newline character is deleted on input and added before the newline character on output . To open a file in text mode , append 't' to the permission specifier , for example ' rt ' and ' w + t '. ( On Unix , text and binary mode are the same , so this has no effect . On PC systems this is critical .) If the file is opened in update mode ( '+' ), you must use an FSEEK or FREWIND between an input command like FREAD , FSCANF , FGETS , or FGETL and an output command like FWRITE or FPRINTF . You must also use an FSEEK or FREWIND between an output command and an input command . Two file identifiers are automatically available and need not be opened . They are FID = 1 ( standard output ) and FID = 2 ( standard error ). [ FID , MESSAGE ] = FOPEN ( FILENAME ,...) returns a system dependent error message if the open is not successful . [ FID , MESSAGE ] = FOPEN ( FILENAME , PERMISSION , MACHINEFORMAT ) opens the specified file with the specified PERMISSION and treats data read using FREAD or data written using FWRITE as having a format given by MACHINEFORMAT . MACHINEFORMAT is one of the following: ' native ' or 'n' - local machine format - the default ' ieee - le ' or 'l' - IEEE floating point with little - endian byte ordering ' ieee - be ' or 'b' - IEEE floating point with big - endian byte ordering ' ieee - le . l64 ' or 'a' - IEEE floating point with little - endian byte ordering and 64 bit long data type ' ieee - be . l64 ' or 's' - IEEE floating point with big - endian byte ordering and 64 bit long data type . [ FID , MESSAGE ] = FOPEN ( FILENAME , PERMISSION , MACHINEFORMAT , ENCODING ) opens the specified file using the specified PERMISSION and MACHINEFORMAT . ENCODING specifies the name of a character encoding scheme associated with the file . It must be the empty character vector (''), empty string ( \"\" ), or a name , or alias for an encoding scheme . Some examples are ' UTF - 8 ', ' latin1 ', ' US - ASCII ', and ' Shift_JIS '. For common names and aliases , see the Web site http: //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. If ENCODING is unspecified , or is the empty character vector (''), or is the empty string ( \"\" ), MATLAB ' s default encoding scheme is used . [ FILENAME , PERMISSION , MACHINEFORMAT , ENCODING ] = FOPEN ( FID ) returns the filename , permission , machine format , and character encoding values used by MATLAB when it opened the file associated with identifier FID . MATLAB does not determine these output values by reading information from the opened file . For any of these parameters that were not specified when the file was opened , MATLAB returns its default value . The ENCODING is a standard character encoding scheme name that may not be the same as the ENCODING argument used in the call to FOPEN that opened the file . An invalid FID returns empty character vector ('') for all output arguments . FIDS = FOPEN (' all ') returns a row vector containing the file identifiers for all the files currently opened by the user ( but not 1 or 2 ). The 'W' and 'A' permissions do not automatically perform a flush of the current output buffer after output operations . See also FCLOSE , FERROR , FGETL , FGETS , FPRINTF , FREAD , FSCANF , FSEEK , FTELL , FWRITE . fread - FREAD Read binary data from file. A = FREAD(FID) reads binary data from the specified file and writes it into matrix A. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN. MATLAB reads the entire file and positions the file pointer at the end of the file (see FEOF for details). A = FREAD ( FID , SIZE ) reads the number of elements specified by SIZE . Valid entries for SIZE are : N read N elements into a column vector . inf read to the end of the file . [ M , N ] read elements to fill an M-by-N matrix , in column order . N can be inf , but M can 't. A = FREAD(FID,SIZE,PRECISION) reads the file according to the data format specified by PRECISION. The PRECISION input commonly contains a datatype specifier like ' int ' or ' float ', followed by an integer giving the size in bits. The SIZE argument is optional when using this syntax. Any of the following values, either the MATLAB version, or their C or Fortran equivalent, may be used for PRECISION. If not specified, the default PRECISION is ' uint8 '. MATLAB C or Fortran Description ' uchar ' ' unsigned char ' unsigned integer, 8 bits. ' schar ' ' signed char ' signed integer, 8 bits. ' int8 ' ' integer * 1 ' integer, 8 bits. ' int16 ' ' integer * 2 ' integer, 16 bits. ' int32 ' ' integer * 4 ' integer, 32 bits. ' int64 ' ' integer * 8 ' integer, 64 bits. ' uint8 ' ' integer * 1 ' unsigned integer, 8 bits. ' uint16 ' ' integer * 2 ' unsigned integer, 16 bits. ' uint32 ' ' integer * 4 ' unsigned integer, 32 bits. ' uint64 ' ' integer * 8 ' unsigned integer, 64 bits. ' single ' ' real * 4 ' floating point, 32 bits. ' float32 ' ' real * 4 ' floating point, 32 bits. ' double ' ' real * 8 ' floating point, 64 bits. ' float64 ' ' real * 8 ' floating point, 64 bits. The following platform dependent formats are also supported but they are not guaranteed to be the same size on all platforms. MATLAB C or Fortran Description ' char ' ' char * 1 ' character. ' short ' ' short ' integer, 16 bits. ' int ' ' int ' integer, 32 bits. ' long ' ' long ' integer, 32 or 64 bits. ' ushort ' ' unsigned short ' unsigned integer, 16 bits. ' uint ' ' unsigned int ' unsigned integer, 32 bits. ' ulong ' ' unsigned long ' unsigned integer, 32 bits or 64 bits. ' float ' ' float ' floating point, 32 bits. If the precision is ' char ' or ' char * 1 ', MATLAB reads characters using the encoding scheme associated with the file. See FOPEN for more information. The following formats map to an input stream of bits rather than bytes. ' bitN ' signed integer, N bits (1<=N<=64). ' ubitN ' unsigned integer, N bits (1<=N<=64). If the input stream is bytes and FREAD reaches the end of file (see FEOF) in the middle of reading the number of bytes required for an element, the partial result is ignored. However, if the input stream is bits, then the partial result is returned as the last value. If an error occurs before reaching the end of file, only full elements read up to that point are used. By default, numeric and character values are returned in class ' double ' arrays. To return these values stored in classes other than double, create your PRECISION argument by first specifying your source format, then following it by ' => ', and finally specifying your destination format. If the source and destination formats are the same then the following shorthand notation may be used: *source which means: source=>source For example, uint8=>uint8 read in unsigned 8-bit integers and save them in an unsigned 8-bit integer array *uint8 shorthand version of previous example bit4=>int8 read in signed 4-bit integers packed in bytes and save them in a signed 8-bit integer array (each 4-bit integer becomes one 8-bit integer) double=>real*4 read in doubles, convert and save as a 32-bit floating point array A = FREAD(FID,SIZE,PRECISION,SKIP) includes a SKIP argument that specifies the number of bytes to skip after each PRECISION value is read. If PRECISION specifies a bit source format, like ' bitN ' or ' ubitN ', the SKIP argument is interpreted as the number of bits to skip. The SIZE argument is optional when using this syntax. When SKIP is used, the PRECISION specifier may contain a positive integer repetition factor of the form ' N * ' which prepends the source format of the PRECISION argument, like ' 40 * uchar '. Note that 40*uchar for the PRECISION alone is equivalent to ' 40 * uchar => double ', not ' 40 * uchar => uchar '. With SKIP specified, FREAD reads in, at most, a repetition factor number of values (default of 1), does a skip of input specified by the SKIP argument, reads in another block of values and does a skip of input, etc. until SIZE number of values have been read. If a SKIP argument is not specified, the repetition factor is ignored. Repetition with skip is useful for extracting data in noncontiguous fields from fixed length records. For example, s = fread(fid,120,' 40 * uchar => uchar ',8); reads in 120 characters in blocks of 40 each separated by 8 characters. A = FREAD(FID,SIZE,PRECISION,SKIP,MACHINEFORMAT) treats the data read as having a format given by the MACHINEFORMAT. You can obtain the MACHINEFORMAT argument from the output of the FOPEN function. See FOPEN for possible values for MACHINEFORMAT. The SIZE and SKIP arguments are optional when using this syntax. [ A , COUNT ] = FREAD(...) Optional output argument COUNT returns the number of elements successfully read. Examples: The file alphabet.txt contains the 26 letters of the English alphabet, all capitalized. Open the file for read access with fopen, and read the first five elements into output c. Because a precision has not been specified, MATLAB uses the default precision of uchar, and the output is numeric: fid = fopen(' alphabet . txt ', ' r '); c = fread(fid, 5)' c = 65 66 67 68 69 fclose ( fid ); This time , specify that you want each element read as an unsigned 8-bit integer and output as a character . ( Using a precision of 'char=>char' or '*char' will produce the same result ): fid = fopen ( 'alphabet.txt' , 'r' ); c = fread ( fid , 5 , 'uint8=>char' ) ' c = ABCDE fclose ( fid ); See also FWRITE , FSEEK , FSCANF , FGETL , FGETS , LOAD , FOPEN , FEOF . fseek - FSEEK Set file position indicator. STATUS = FSEEK(FID, OFFSET, ORIGIN) repositions the file position indicator in the file associated with the given FID. FSEEK sets the position indicator to the byte with the specified OFFSET relative to ORIGIN. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN . OFFSET values are interpreted as follows : >= 0 Move position indicator OFFSET bytes after ORIGIN . < 0 Move position indicator OFFSET bytes before ORIGIN . ORIGIN values are interpreted as follows : ' bof ' or - 1 Beginning of file ' cof ' or 0 Current position in file ' eof ' or 1 End of file STATUS is 0 on success and - 1 on failure . If an error occurs , use FERROR to get more information . Example : fseek ( fid , 0 , - 1 ) \" rewinds \" the file . See also FERROR , FOPEN , FPRINTF , FREAD , FREWIND , FSCANF , FSEEK , FTELL , FWRITE . ftell - FTELL Get file position indicator. POSITION = FTELL(FID) returns the location of the file position indicator in the specified file. Position is indicated in bytes from the beginning of the file. If -1 is returned, it indicates that the query was unsuccessful. Use FERROR to determine the nature of the error. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN. See also FERROR, FOPEN, FPRINTF, FREAD, FREWIND, FSCANF, FSEEK, FWRITE. fwrite - FWRITE Write binary data to file. COUNT = FWRITE(FID,A) writes the elements of matrix A to the specified file. The data are written in column order. COUNT is the number of elements successfully written. FID is an integer file identifier obtained from FOPEN , or 1 for standard output or 2 for standard error . COUNT = FWRITE ( FID , A , PRECISION ) writes the elements of matrix A to the specified file , translating MATLAB values to the specified precision . PRECISION controls the form and size of the result . See the list of allowed precisions under FREAD . If PRECISION is not specified , MATLAB uses the default , which is ' uint8 ' . If either ' bitN ' or ' ubitN ' is used for the PRECISION then any out of range value of A is written as a value with all bits turned on . If the precision is ' char ' or ' char*1 ' , MATLAB writes characters using the encoding scheme associated with the file . See FOPEN for more information . COUNT = FWRITE ( FID , A , PRECISION , SKIP ) includes an optional SKIP argument that specifies the number of bytes to skip before each PRECISION value is written . With the SKIP argument present , FWRITE skips and writes a value , skips and writes another value , etc . until all of A is written . If PRECISION is a bit format like ' bitN ' or ' ubitN ' SKIP is specified in bits . This is useful for inserting data into noncontiguous fields in fixed length records . COUNT = FWRITE ( FID , A , PRECISION , SKIP , MACHINEFORMAT ) treats the data written as having a format given by MACHINEFORMAT . You can obtain the MACHINEFORMAT argument from the output of the FOPEN function . See FOPEN for possible values for MACHINEFORMAT . For example , fid = fopen ( ' magic5.bin ' , ' wb ' ) fwrite ( fid , magic ( 5 ) , ' integer*4 ' ) creates a 100 - byte binary file , containing the 25 elements of the 5 - by - 5 magic square , stored as 4 - byte integers .

For example, if there is one epoch with clock types 'dev_local_time' and 'utc', then M is 2. Each entry COST(i,j) indicates whether there is a mapping between (epoch, clocktype) i to j. The cost of each transformation is normally 1 operation. MAPPING is the ndi.time.timemapping object that describes the mapping.

If it doesn't exist, it should be created. EPOCH_NUMBER can be a number of an EPOCH ID string. The abstract class just queries the EPOCHTABLE. Most classes that manage epochs themselves (ndi.file.navigator, ndi.daq.system) will override this method. Help for ndi.element.timeseries/epochid is inherited from superclass NDI.EPOCH.EPOCHSET epochnodes - return all epoch nodes from an ndi.epoch.epochset object [NODES,UNDERLYINGNODES] = EPOCHNODES(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) Return all EPOCHNODES for an ndi.epoch.epochset.

If there is no | 'name' field, then 'unknown' is used. 'objectclass' | The object class name of the NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ. EPOCHNODES are related to EPOCHTABLE entries, except a) only 1 ndi.time.clocktype is permitted per epoch node. If an entry in epoch table contains multiple ndi.time.clocktype entries, then each one will have its own epoch node. This aids in the construction of the EPOCHGRAPH that helps the system map time from one epoch to another. b) EPOCHNODES contain identifying information (objectname and objectclass) to help in identifying the epoch nodes across ndi.epoch.epochset objects. UNDERLYINGNODES are nodes that are directly linked to this ndi.epoch.epochset's node via 'underlying' epochs.

'underlying_epochs' | A structure array of the ndi.epoch.epochset objects that comprise these epochs. | It contains fields 'underlying', 'epoch_number', 'epoch_id', and 'epochprobemap' HASHVALUE is the hashed value of the epochtable. One can check to see if the epochtable has changed with ndi.epoch.epochset/MATCHEDEPOCHTABLE.

If it is a simple integer, then INT2STR is used to produce a string. If it is an epoch identifier string, then it is returned. epochclock - return the ndi.time.clocktype objects for an epoch EC = EPOCHCLOCK(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, EPOCH_NUMBER) Return the clock types available for this epoch as a cell array of ndi.time.clocktype objects (or sub-class members). The abstract class always returns ndi.time.clocktype('no_time') See also: ndi.time.clocktype, T0_T1 epochgraph - graph of the mapping and cost of converting time among epochs [COST, MAPPING] = EPOCHGRAPH(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) Compute the cost and the mapping among epochs in the EPOCHTABLE for an ndi.epoch.epochset object COST is an MxM matrix where M is the number of ordered pairs of (epochs, clocktypes). For example, if there is one epoch with clock types 'dev_local_time' and 'utc', then M is 2. Each entry COST(i,j) indicates whether there is a mapping between (epoch, clocktype) i to j. The cost of each transformation is normally 1 operation. MAPPING is the ndi.time.timemapping object that describes the mapping. epochid - Get the epoch identifier for a particular epoch ID = EPOCHID (NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, EPOCH_NUMBER) Returns the epoch identifier string for the epoch EPOCH_NUMBER. If it doesn't exist, it should be created. EPOCH_NUMBER can be a number of an EPOCH ID string. The abstract class just queries the EPOCHTABLE. Most classes that manage epochs themselves (ndi.file.navigator, ndi.daq.system) will override this method. epochnodes - return all epoch nodes from an ndi.epoch.epochset object [NODES,UNDERLYINGNODES] = EPOCHNODES(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) Return all EPOCHNODES for an ndi.epoch.epochset. EPOCHNODES consist of the following fields: Fieldname: | Description 'epoch_id' | The epoch ID code (will never change once established, though it may be deleted.) | This epoch ID uniquely specifies the epoch within the session. 'epoch_session_id' | The ID of the session that contains the epoch 'epochprobemap' | Any contents information for each epoch, usually of type ndi.epoch.epochprobemap or empty. 'epoch_clock' | A SINGLE ndi.time.clocktype entry that describes the clock type of this node. 't0_t1' | The times [t0 t1] of the beginning and end of the epoch in units of 'epoch_clock' 'underlying_epochs' | A structure array of the ndi.epoch.epochset objects that comprise these epochs. | It contains fields 'underlying', 'epoch_id', and 'epochprobemap' 'objectname' | A string containing the 'name' field of NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, if it exists. If there is no | 'name' field, then 'unknown' is used. 'objectclass' | The object class name of the NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ. EPOCHNODES are related to EPOCHTABLE entries, except a) only 1 ndi.time.clocktype is permitted per epoch node. If an entry in epoch table contains multiple ndi.time.clocktype entries, then each one will have its own epoch node. This aids in the construction of the EPOCHGRAPH that helps the system map time from one epoch to another. b) EPOCHNODES contain identifying information (objectname and objectclass) to help in identifying the epoch nodes across ndi.epoch.epochset objects. UNDERLYINGNODES are nodes that are directly linked to this ndi.epoch.epochset's node via 'underlying' epochs. epochset - constructor for ndi.epoch.epochset objects NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ = ndi.epoch.epochset() This class has no parameters so the constructor is called with no input arguments. epochsetname - the name of the ndi.epoch.epochset object, for EPOCHNODES NAME = EPOCHSETNAME(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) Returns the object name that is used when creating epoch nodes. If the class has a 'name' property, that property is used. Otherwise, 'unknown' is used. epochtable - Return an epoch table that relates the current object's epochs to underlying epochs [ET,HASHVALUE] = EPOCHTABLE(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) ET is a structure array with the following fields: Fieldname: | Description 'epoch_number' | The number of the epoch.

'epoch_session_id' | The session ID that contains this epoch 'epochprobemap' | Any contents information for each epoch, usually of type ndi.epoch.epochprobemap or empty. 'epoch_clock' | A cell array of ndi.time.clocktype objects that describe the type of clocks available 't0_t1' | A cell array of ordered pairs [t0 t1] that indicates, for each ndi.time.clocktype, the start and stop | time of this epoch. The time units of t0_t1{i} match epoch_clock{i}. 'underlying_epochs' | A structure array of the ndi.epoch.epochset objects that comprise these epochs. | It contains fields 'underlying', 'epoch_number', 'epoch_id', and 'epochprobemap' HASHVALUE is the hashed value of the epochtable. One can check to see if the epochtable has changed with ndi.epoch.epochset/MATCHEDEPOCHTABLE. After it is read from disk once, the ET is stored in memory and is not re-read from disk unless the user calls ndi.epoch.epochset/RESETEPOCHTABLE. epochtableentry - return the entry of the EPOCHTABLE that corresonds to an EPOCHID ET_ENTRY = EPOCHTABLEENTRY(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, EPOCH_NUMBER_OR_ID) Returns the EPOCHTABLE entry associated with the ndi.epoch.epochset object that corresponds to EPOCH_NUMBER_OR_ID, which can be the number of the epoch or the EPOCHID of the epoch. getcache - return the NDI_CACHE and key for an ndi.epoch.epochset object [CACHE, KEY] = GETCACHE(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) Returns the NDI_CACHE object CACHE and the KEY used by the ndi.epoch.epochset object NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ. In this abstract class, no cache is available, so CACHE and KEY are empty. But subclasses can engage the cache services of the class by returning an NDI_CACHE object and a unique key. issyncgraphroot - should this object be a root in an ndi.time.syncgraph epoch graph? B = ISSYNCGRAPHROOT(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) This function tells an ndi.time.syncgraph object whether it should continue adding the 'underlying' epochs to the graph, or whether it should stop at this level. For ndi.epoch.epochset objects, this returns 1. For some object types (ndi.probe.*, for example) this will return 0 so that the underlying ndi.daq.system epochs are added. matchedepochtable - compare a hash number from an epochtable to the current version B = MATCHEDEPOCHTABLE(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, HASHVALUE) Returns 1 if the current hashed value of the cached epochtable is identical to HASHVALUE. Otherwise, it returns 0. numepochs - Number of epochs of ndi.epoch.epochset N = NUMEPOCHS(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) Returns the number of epochs in the ndi.epoch.epochset object NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ. See also: EPOCHTABLE resetepochtable - clear an ndi.epoch.epochset epochtable in memory and force it to be re-read from disk NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ = RESETEPOCHTABLE(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ) This function clears the internal cached memory of the epochtable, forcing it to be re-read from disk at the next request. See also: ndi.epoch.epochset/EPOCHTABLE t0_t1 - return the t0_t1 (beginning and end) epoch times for an epoch T0T1 = T0_T1(NDI_EPOCHSET_OBJ, EPOCH_NUMBER) Return the beginning (t0) and end (t1) times of the epoch EPOCH_NUMBER in the same units as the ndi.time.clocktype objects returned by EPOCHCLOCK.

Y = FILTER(B,A,X) filters the data in vector X with the filter described by vectors A and B to create the filtered data Y.

FILTER always operates along the first non - singleton dimension , namely dimension 1 for column vectors and non - trivial matrices , and dimension 2 for row vectors . [ Y , Zf ] = FILTER ( B , A , X , Zi ) gives access to initial and final conditions , Zi and Zf , of the delays . Zi is a vector of length MAX ( LENGTH ( A ) , LENGTH ( B )) - 1 , or an array with the leading dimension of size MAX ( LENGTH ( A ) , LENGTH ( B )) - 1 and with remaining dimensions matching those of X . FILTER ( B , A , X ,[], DIM ) or FILTER ( B , A , X , Zi , DIM ) operates along the dimension DIM . Tip : If you have the Signal Processing Toolbox , you can design a filter , D , using DESIGNFILT .

Lab / addlistener doc handle . addlistener buttons - ndi.gui.Lab/buttons is a function. buttons(obj) connect - diagram interconnections of dynamic systems. CONNECT computes an aggregate model for a block diagram interconnection of dynamic systems. You can specify the block diagram connectivity in two ways: Name-based interconnection In this approach, you name the input and output signals of all blocks SYS1, SYS2,... in the block diagram, including the summation blocks. The aggregate model SYS is then built by SYS = CONNECT(SYS1,SYS2,...,INPUTS,OUTPUTS) where INPUTS and OUTPUTS are the names of the block diagram external I/Os (specified as strings or string vectors). If you also need to perform open - loop analysis at specific locations in the block diagram , use SYS = CONNECT ( SYS1 , SYS2 , ... , INPUTS , OUTPUTS , APS ) where APS lists the locations ( internal signals ) of interest . The resulting model SYS contains analysis points at the locations APS ( see AnalysisPoint ) . Example 1 : Given SISO models C and G , you can construct the closed - loop transfer T from r to y using e u r ---> O --> [ C ] --- [ G ] -+---> y - | | +<----------------+ C . InputName = 'e' ; C . OutputName = 'u' ; G . InputName = 'u' ; G . OutputName = 'y' ; Sum = sumblk ( 'e = r-y' ); T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , 'y' ) Example 2 : If C and G above are two - input , two - output models instead , you can form the MIMO transfer T from r to y using C . u = 'e' ; C . y = 'u' ; G . u = 'u' ; G . y = 'y' ; Sum = sumblk ( 'e = r-y' , 2 ); T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , 'y' ) Note that C . u , C . y is shorthand for C . InputName , C . OutputName and that 'r' , 'y' select all entries of the two - entry vector signals r and y . Example 3 : If you already have specified I / O names for C and G , you can build the closed - loop model T using : Sum = sumblk ( ' %e = r - %y' , C . u , G . y ); T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , G . y ) See SUMBLK for more details on using aliases like % e and % y . Example 4 : To add an analysis point at the plant input \"u\" and then access the open - loop response L = C * G at this location , use T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , 'y' , 'u' ) L = getLoopTransfer ( T , 'u' , - 1 ); Index-based interconnection In this approach, first combine all system blocks into an aggregate, unconnected model BLKSYS using APPEND. Then construct a matrix Q where each row specifies one of the connections or summing junctions in terms of the input vector U and output vector Y of BLKSYS. For example, the row [3 2 0 0] indicates that Y(2) feeds into U(3), while the row [7 2 -15 6] indicates that Y(2) - Y(15) + Y(6) feeds into U(7). The aggregate model SYS is then obtained by SYS = CONNECT(BLKSYS,Q,INPUTS,OUTPUTS) where INPUTS and OUTPUTS are index vectors into U and Y selecting the block diagram external I/Os. Example : You can construct the closed - loop model T for the block diagram above as follows : BLKSYS = append ( C , G ); % U = inputs to C , G . Y = outputs of C , G % Here Y ( 1 ) feeds into U ( 2 ) and - Y ( 2 ) feeds into U ( 1 ) Q = [ 2 1 ; 1 - 2 ]; % External I / Os : r drives U ( 1 ) and y is Y ( 2 ) T = connect ( BLKSYS , Q , 1 , 2 ) Note : * CONNECT always returns a state - space or FRD model SYS * States that do not contribute to the I / O transfer from INPUTS to OUTPUTS are automatically discarded . To prevent this , set the \"Simplify\" option to FALSE : OPT = connectOptions ( 'Simplify' , false ); SYS = CONNECT (..., OPT ) See also SUMBLK , connectOptions , APPEND , SERIES , PARALLEL , FEEDBACK , LFT , DynamicSystem . cut - ndi.gui.Lab/cut is a function. cut(obj, src, ~) delete - DELETE Delete a handle object.

CONNECT computes an aggregate model for a block diagram interconnection of dynamic systems. You can specify the block diagram connectivity in two ways: Name-based interconnection In this approach, you name the input and output signals of all blocks SYS1, SYS2,... in the block diagram, including the summation blocks. The aggregate model SYS is then built by SYS = CONNECT(SYS1,SYS2,...,INPUTS,OUTPUTS) where INPUTS and OUTPUTS are the names of the block diagram external I/Os (specified as strings or string vectors). If you also need to perform open - loop analysis at specific locations in the block diagram , use SYS = CONNECT ( SYS1 , SYS2 , ... , INPUTS , OUTPUTS , APS ) where APS lists the locations ( internal signals ) of interest . The resulting model SYS contains analysis points at the locations APS ( see AnalysisPoint ) . Example 1 : Given SISO models C and G , you can construct the closed - loop transfer T from r to y using e u r ---> O --> [ C ] --- [ G ] -+---> y - | | +<----------------+ C . InputName = 'e' ; C . OutputName = 'u' ; G . InputName = 'u' ; G . OutputName = 'y' ; Sum = sumblk ( 'e = r-y' ); T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , 'y' ) Example 2 : If C and G above are two - input , two - output models instead , you can form the MIMO transfer T from r to y using C . u = 'e' ; C . y = 'u' ; G . u = 'u' ; G . y = 'y' ; Sum = sumblk ( 'e = r-y' , 2 ); T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , 'y' ) Note that C . u , C . y is shorthand for C . InputName , C . OutputName and that 'r' , 'y' select all entries of the two - entry vector signals r and y . Example 3 : If you already have specified I / O names for C and G , you can build the closed - loop model T using : Sum = sumblk ( ' %e = r - %y' , C . u , G . y ); T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , G . y ) See SUMBLK for more details on using aliases like % e and % y . Example 4 : To add an analysis point at the plant input \"u\" and then access the open - loop response L = C * G at this location , use T = connect ( G , C , Sum , 'r' , 'y' , 'u' ) L = getLoopTransfer ( T , 'u' , - 1 ); Index-based interconnection In this approach, first combine all system blocks into an aggregate, unconnected model BLKSYS using APPEND. Then construct a matrix Q where each row specifies one of the connections or summing junctions in terms of the input vector U and output vector Y of BLKSYS. For example, the row [3 2 0 0] indicates that Y(2) feeds into U(3), while the row [7 2 -15 6] indicates that Y(2) - Y(15) + Y(6) feeds into U(7). The aggregate model SYS is then obtained by SYS = CONNECT(BLKSYS,Q,INPUTS,OUTPUTS) where INPUTS and OUTPUTS are index vectors into U and Y selecting the block diagram external I/Os. Example : You can construct the closed - loop model T for the block diagram above as follows : BLKSYS = append ( C , G ); % U = inputs to C , G . Y = outputs of C , G % Here Y ( 1 ) feeds into U ( 2 ) and - Y ( 2 ) feeds into U ( 1 ) Q = [ 2 1 ; 1 - 2 ]; % External I / Os : r drives U ( 1 ) and y is Y ( 2 ) T = connect ( BLKSYS , Q , 1 , 2 ) Note : * CONNECT always returns a state - space or FRD model SYS * States that do not contribute to the I / O transfer from INPUTS to OUTPUTS are automatically discarded . To prevent this , set the \"Simplify\" option to FALSE : OPT = connectOptions ( 'Simplify' , false ); SYS = CONNECT (..., OPT ) See also SUMBLK , connectOptions , APPEND , SERIES , PARALLEL , FEEDBACK , LFT , DynamicSystem . cut - ndi.gui.Lab/cut is a function. cut(obj, src, ~) delete - DELETE Delete a handle object.

We assume you have already installed NDI and taken the introductory tutorial of the NDI model . These data are available in a compressed folder here . You can put the folder anywhere, but we will assume that you put them in your MATLAB/Documents/NDI folder, where MATLAB is your normal user path in Matlab (usually /Users/username/Documents/MATLAB on a Mac). Normally, we'd use some helper functions to open our data to make this process even easier, but this tutorial takes the user through the full manual process for training purposes. 2.1.1 Introduction to the experiment \u00b6 These data are single neuron recordings made with electrodes in the anesthetized tree shrew visual as a part of Van Hooser et al. 2013 . This example data is a very small subset of the original data for the purposes of illustration. In this experiment, a single unit recording electrode was inserted into either lateral geniculate nucleus or V1. The electrode was connected to an amplifier, and the output signal was recorded by a Cambridge Electronic Design (CED) micro1401 digital acquisition board. A CED Spike2 software script was used that stored 1 recording epoch per folder. In software, the voltage from the electrode was assigned to channel 11. A visual stimulus monitor was set up in front of the animal, and visual stimuli were generated by custom software running on a separate computer. A record of the stimulus parameters was stored in the epoch folder in a file called stims.mat , and stimulus timing information was delievered to the digital inputs of the micro1401 in the form of a stimulus onset trigger and an 8-bit stimulus code signal that were generated by the stimulus computer. 2.1.2 Introduction to the data \u00b6 The data are in a folder called ts_exper1 . It contains recordings of two neurons, an LGN neuron and a V1 neuron, to presentation of sinusoidal gratings that either vary in orientation or in spatial frequency. The data as provided by the host lab are organized into subfolders, named t00001 , t00002 , t00003 , and t00004 . The first two folders are recordings of the LGN neuron, and the second two folders are recordings of the V1 neuron. Each t0000N folder has 3 files: probemap.txt - a file that we made for NDI that describe what probes are recorded in this folder spike2data.smr - a CED Spike2 file that has the raw electrophysiology data and the stimulus timing information stims.mat - A Matlab file that has detailed parameters of the stimuli that were run First, let's list these files using the ls command (that's the letter l followed by the letter s , short for list ) and take a quick look at what is in them. Set up the \"prefix\" path to your data as necessary. (Here, we assume you put the ts_exper1 folder into your Matlab userpath folder but you can put it anywhere. Code block 2.1.2.1. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 prefix = [ userpath filesep 'Documents' filesep 'NDI' ]; % or '/Users/yourusername/Desktop/' if you put it on the desktop perhaps ls ([ prefix filesep 'ts_exper1' filesep 't*' ]); % list all the files in the t0000N folders We wrote a short function so that you can see the raw voltage recording and the stimulus timing information. Each stimulus appears as a number and its duration is indicated by the black bar. You can pan with the mouse to scroll through the recording. Code block 2.1.2.2. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 my_smr_file = fullfile ( prefix , 'ts_exper1' , 't00001' , 'spike2data.smr' ) ndi . example . tutorial . plottreeshrewdata ( my_smr_file ); You should see a Matlab window that looks like this, and when you hover your mouse over the image, it should turn into a \"hand\" that allows you to drag and pan around. 2.1.3 Specifying the metadata that NDI needs to read the experiment \u00b6 In this example, we have already prepared the metadata files that are necessary for NDI to read the data. Let's look at them in turn. First, we need to tell NDI what probes we have in our experiment. A probe is anything that measures or stimulates; one end of a probe is connected to a subject , and the other end of a probe is connected to a data acquisition device. We tell NDI how the probe is connected by creating an ndi.epoch.epochprobemap . Usually, we do this with a little code that instructs NDI how to read this information directly from the laboratory's own file information, but in this example we will use the generic ndi.daq.metadata.epochprobemap_daqsystem object, which reads in a simple tab-delimited text file. Let's print the probemap.txt file for directory t00001 : Code block 2.1.3.1. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 type ( fullfile ( prefix , 'ts_exper1' , 't00001' , 'probemap.txt' )) You will see a tab-delimited text table that looks like the following. In the Matlab command window, the tabs may not line up, so don't be concerned if it doesn't look like a nice formatted table. name reference type devicestring subjectstring ctx 1 n-trode ced_daqsystem:ai11 treeshrew_12345@mylab.org vis_stim 1 stimulator vis_daqsystem:mk30;text30;md1 treeshrew_12345@mylab.org This text file has all of the information to specify the probe and its connections. It has a name for the probe that is meaningful to the user, and the reference specifies an identifier that groups the recordings of the probe. Typically, when the probe is in one physical position, the reference number is kept the same, but when the probe is moved (such as when an electrode is advanced), the reference number is incremented. This tells NDI to try to combine information from recordings that have the same name and reference. type tells NDI what type of probe it is. There are a variety of pre-determined types, and this type instructs NDI (via this file ) which probe object type to create in software. Second, we need to specify the stimulus parameters metadata. Typically, one would create a metadata reader for ones own lab so that the native data can be read directly, but here we have made another tab-delimited text file with the parameters. You can read this for yourself by typing the following: Code block 2.1.3.2. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 type ( fullfile ( prefix , 'ts_exper1' , 't00001' , 'stims.tsv' )) 2.1.4 Gaining acess to the data in NDI: ndi.session and ndi.daq.system objects \u00b6 Now all that remains is to open the data directory as an ndi.session object, and make ndi.daq.system objects to read your data. We will use an ndi.session.dir object, which allows us to read information from a directory (folder) on disk. We will create a new ndi.system object by calling the constructor with the reference name we wish to give to the session and the pathname to our data: Code block 2.1.4.1. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 S = ndi . session . dir ( 'ts_exper1' ,[ prefix filesep 'ts_exper1' ]) Now you have made a new NDI session. The session is brand new, and doesn't know about any of the devices we used in our experiment. So, if we try to see if there are any probes, we will see that it doesn't know of any: Code block 2.1.4.2. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 S . getprobes () Unless you ran this demo before, you won't see any probes here (it will return an empty cell array). We need to make new ndi.daq.system objects for our data acquisition system and our stimulator. Our devices are multifunction data acquisition systems, so we use the ndi.daq.system.mfdaq subtype. An ndi.daq.system object consists of three components: an ndi.file.navigator object whose job it is to find the files or streams associated with each epoch of data, an ndi.daq.reader object whose job it is to read the raw data from the files, and an ndi.daq.metadatareader (optionally) whose job it is to read any metadata associated with the epoch (such as stimulus parameter information). First, we will build an ndi.daq.system.mfdaq object that we will call 'ced_daqsystem' to read the electrode data from our CED SMR files. Code block 2.1.4.3. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 ced_filenav = ndi . file . navigator ( S , { '.*\\.smr\\>' , 'probemap.txt' }, ... 'ndi.daq.metadata.epochprobemap_daqsystem' , 'probemap.txt' ); ced_rdr = ndi . daq . reader . mfdaq . cedspike2 (); ced_system = ndi . daq . system . mfdaq ( 'ced_daqsystem' , ced_filenav , ced_rdr ); % if you haven't already added the daq system, you can add it here: S . daqsystem_add ( ced_system ); Note: If you ran the tutorial before, you may have added ced_system to your session S already. That's fine, you'll get an error if you try to do it again. If you want to remove all your daq systems, you can call ndi.session.daqsystem_clear() by typing S.daqsystem_clear() and then you can add them again. Let's look at the epochs that ced_system can find, in order to understand how it searches for epochs: Code block 2.1.4.4 Type this into Matlab \u00b6 % let's look at the epochs the daq.system can find et = ced_system . epochtable () % should see a 4 element answer f = ced_system . filenavigator . getepochfiles ( 1 ) % you should see the files from epoch 1, t00001 Second, we will build an ndi.daq.system.mfdaq for our visual stimulus system. Code block 2.1.4.5. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 vis_filenav = ndi . file . navigator ( S , { '.*\\.smr\\>' , 'probemap.txt' , 'stims.tsv' }, ... 'ndi.daq.metadata.epochprobemap_daqsystem' , 'probemap.txt' ); vis_rdr = ndi . daq . reader . mfdaq . cedspike2 (); vis_mdrdr = ndi . daq . metadatareader ( 'stims.tsv' ); vis_system = ndi . daq . system . mfdaq ( 'vis_daqsystem' , vis_filenav , vis_rdr , { vis_mdrdr }); % if you haven't already added the daq system, you can add it here: S . daqsystem_add ( vis_system ); Last, we will tell NDI how these devices are synchronized with each other. These two daq systems have a file in common ( spike2data.smr ), which means that they have a common time base, but NDI doesn't yet know that the two daq systems can be synchronized. Here we add a \"syncrule\" that tells NDI that any daq systems that share at least 2 files per epoch also share a common time clock for that epoch. Code block 2.1.4.6. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 nsf = ndi . time . syncrule . filematch ( struct ( 'number_fullpath_matches' , 2 )); S . syncgraph_addrule ( nsf ); 2.1.5 Opening the data in NDI: accessing probes via from ndi.daq.system.mfdaq \u00b6 Now we can use NDI to see the probes that these daq systems can find, and to access the data from those probes. Let's look at the electrode probe data first. Code block 2.1.5.1. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 p = S . getprobes () % get all of the probes that are in the ndi.session S for i = 1 : numel ( p ), p { i }, end ; % display the probe information for each probe % look at the number of epochs recorded for probe 1 p_ctx1_list = S . getprobes ( 'name' , 'ctx' , 'reference' , 1 ) % returns a cell array of matches p_ctx1 = p_ctx1_list { 1 }; % take the first one, should be the only one et = p_ctx1 . epochtable () for i = 1 : numel ( et ), et ( i ), end ; % display the epoch table entries epoch_to_read = 1 ; You can see that probe 1 has a name of ctx , a reference of 1 , and it is of type n-trode , or an n-channel electrode. It has a software object type of ndi.probe.timeseries.mfdaq , which simply means it is associated with multifunction DAQ systems and returns timeseries observations. Now let's read data from our probe p_ctx1 and plot the data: Code block 2.1.5.2. Type this into Matlab \u00b6 [ data , t , timeref_p_ctx1 ]= p_ctx1 . readtimeseries ( epoch_to_read , - Inf , Inf ); % read all data from epoch 1 figure ( 100 ); plot ( t , data ); xlabel ( 'Time(s)' ); ylabel ( 'Voltage (V)' ); set ( gca , 'xlim' ,[ t ( 1 ) t ( end )]); box off ; This code calls an important function for reading data from probes: ndi.timeseries.readtimeseries : This code is documentation; do not type into Matlab \u00b6 [ D , T , TIMEREF ] = ndi . timeseries . readtimeseries ( EPOCH_OR_TIMEREF , T0 , T1 ) % Reads data and timestamps from an ndi.timeseries.readtimeseries object with respect % to a specific epoch or an ndi.time.timereference object, from time T0 to T1. When analyzing data or writing apps to analyze data, ndi.timeseries.readtimeseries is one of the most commonly called functions. Now let's also look at our stimulator probe vis_stim . First, let's examine the epochs that are known to vis_stim : Code block 2.1.5.3. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 p_visstim_list = S . getprobes ( 'name' , 'vis_stim' , 'reference' , 1 ) % returns a cell array of matches p_visstim = p_visstim_list { 1 }; % take the first one, should be the only one et = p_visstim . epochtable () for i = 1 : numel ( et ), et ( i ), end ; % display the epoch table entries Now let's read the data from our stimulator. To do this, we are going to ask NDI to read the stimulus timing information in the time units of our electrode probe p_ctx . You'll notice that when we read data from p_ctx1 , readtimeseries returned an ndi.time.timereference object timeref_p_ctx1 . Let's examine this quickly: Code block 2.1.5.4. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 timeref_p_ctx1 You'll see a structure with the following fields: timeref_p_ctx1 timereference with properties referent [1x1 ndi.probe.timeseries.mfdaq] clocktype [1x1 ndi.time.clocktype] epoch 1 time 0 session_ID '412687ba08e28694_c0d9c07d0b8726cf' In NDI, one can refer to time with respect to a variety of different clocks, which is helpful because daq systems typically do not have access to a global clock. We can now ask for the time of the stimulus presentations with respect to our electrode's clock, and add the onset times to the graph. Code block 2.1.5.5. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 [ data , t , timeref_stim ]= p_visstim . readtimeseries ( timeref_p_ctx1 , - Inf , Inf ); % read all data from epoch 1 of p_ctx1 ! figure ( 100 ); hold on ; vlt . neuro . stimulus . plot_stimulus_timeseries ( 7 , t . stimon , t . stimon + 2 , 'stimid' , data . stimid ); Let's look at what readtimeseries returned in the case of a stimulator. It is a little different than when being used with regularly-sampled data. Code block 2.1.5.6. Type this in to Matlab: \u00b6 t , % show timestamps t . stimon , data , % show data data . stimid , data . parameters { 1 } Here we examined several fields of the variables data and t returned from readtimeseries from our ndi.probe.timeseries.stimulator . You can see that t is a structure with 2 fields, stimon and stimoff . Our system kept track of when each stimulus began, but in these recordings, we did not have our data acquisition system keep track of when our stimulus turned off. (For later analysis, we will need to read this from the stimulus parameters.) You can also see that data has some metadata about the stimuli. It has the ID number of each stimulus that was shown ( data.stimid(1) is the stimulus that turned on at t.stimon(1) ), and it has the parameters of each stimulus. data.parameters{1} is the parameters of the stimulus with ID number 1. 2.1.6 Discussion/Feedback \u00b6 This concludes our tutorial on the fully manual way of reading data through NDI. In the next tutorial, we'll explore how to create a couple of code objects that read our data directly from a lab's internal structure.

The electrode was connected to an amplifier, and the output signal was recorded by a Cambridge Electronic Design (CED) micro1401 digital acquisition board. A CED Spike2 software script was used that stored 1 recording epoch per folder. In software, the voltage from the electrode was assigned to channel 11. A visual stimulus monitor was set up in front of the animal, and visual stimuli were generated by custom software running on a separate computer. A record of the stimulus parameters was stored in the epoch folder in a file called stims.mat , and stimulus timing information was delievered to the digital inputs of the micro1401 in the form of a stimulus onset trigger and an 8-bit stimulus code signal that were generated by the stimulus computer.","title":"2.1.1 Introduction to the experiment"},{"location":"tutorials/analyzing_first_physiology_experiment/1_example_dataset/#212-introduction-to-the-data","text":"The data are in a folder called ts_exper1 .

Most labs use the same data acquisition devices and file organization schemes over and over again, and many labs also store the necessary metadata that describes the probes and subjects that are acquired. NDI allows you to create small software objects that read this metadata directly from the laboratory files. Then, opening an experimental session becomes as simple as a one line command such as S = ndi . setup . vhlab ([ reference ],[ foldername ]); Once this command has been run once, the directory can be opened with the standard ndi.session.dir command thereafter (though there is no harm to re-issuing the ndi.setup.* command). It's our guess that many labs have at least one person handy with code, and this task might fall to them. This tutorial is written for people who already have some familiarity with coding. If you'd like help creating these functions for your lab, use the issue tracker to post a question. Creating these automatic readers is the biggest stress point in using NDI. The system is relatively easy to use once you are able to read your data! While there are many ways to organize code for custom setups, we have created a motif that is easy to follow. The ndi package in Matlab has a subpackage called setup . Here, we have placed m-files that create an ndi.session with the default settings for various labs or users. The setup package also has a subpackage structure that mimics the subpackage structure of ndi . In Matlab, packages are denoted by putting a + in the folder name: +ndi/+setup/ +daq/ +metadata/ +metadatareader/ +reader/ +system/ 2.2.1 Download an experiment with all vhlab metadata left intact \u00b6 Please download an example data directory called ts_exper2 . Be sure to unzip the files, and we recommend placing them in your Matlab userpath under 'MATLAB/Documents/NDI/' as before. This directory contains the files that were generated at the time of acquisition on Steve's rig in the Fitzpatrick lab at Duke, which is nearly identical to the format that we use in the vhlab now. You'll see that these directories have a few more files. It's not necessary to follow the identities of the files in detail, but let's look at what is in t00001 as an example: t00001/ filetime.txt - The time of the acquisition beginning in seconds from midnight reference.txt = A file describing the probes that are present in this directory spike2data.S2R - This is an irrelevant file! But it's there every time. spike2data.smr - The raw data file acquired by CED's program Spike2 (data acquired via Micro1401) spike2datalog.txt - A text log file (not relevant) stims.mat - The record of stimulation as produced by the stimulus computer. It uses NewStim stimuli and is written by VH lab's RunExperiment program. stimtimes.txt - A text file where each line contains a) the stimulus onset trigger, b) the stimulus ID number between 1-255, and c) an array of video frame trigger times (when the video frame was changed) twophotontimes.txt - A record of triggers of all 2-photon frames. None in this experiment. verticalblanking.txt - A record of each refresh of the monitor. This was not yet used in these experiments but is now part of the VH lab's suite. vhspike2_channelgrouping.txt - A text file that indicates which acquisition channels of our vhspike2 DAQ system are connected to each probe. 2.2.2 Example NDI-matlab files for vhlab \u00b6 To import data from our lab, we created 4 Matlab files: +ndi/+setup/vhlab.m - A function that builds an ndi.session object with daq systems that read from our lab's major devices. +ndi/+setup/+daq/+metadata/epochprobemap_daqsystem_vhlab.m - A class that examines our lab's metadata files that describe the mapping between probes and data acquisition systems and returns an epochprobemap that NDI can interpret. Overrides the default ndi.epoch.epochprobemap_daqsystem.m class that reads the probemap.txt text files we saw in Tutorial 2.1 . +ndi/+setup/+daq/+reader/+mfdaq/+stimulus/vhlabvisspike2.m - A class that reads stimulus event data from our custom acquisition files. +ndi/+daq/+metadatareader/NewStimStims.m - A class that imports stimulus metadata from our lab's open source NewStim package. (We put it in NDI proper because it is an open source program, not intended solely for our lab.) 2.2.3 Creating a setup file. \u00b6 The setup file accomplishes, in an automated fashion, exactly what we did in Tutorial 2.1 : it opens an ndi.session with a particular reference name and directory path, and adds the daq systems that are necessary to read the probe data. It normally lives in +ndi/+setup/LABORINVESTIGATORNAME.m . We include the code here: Code block 2.2.3.1: Content of +ndi/+setup/vhlab.m . (Do not type into Matlab command line.) \u00b6 function S = vhlab ( ref, dirname ) % ndi.setup.vhlab - initialize an ndi.session.dir with VHLAB devices % % S = ndi.setup.vhlab(REF, DIRNAME) % % Initializes an ndi.session.dir object for the directory % DIRNAME with the standard compliment of VHLAB devices, as % found in ndi.setup.daq.system.vhlab. % % If the devices are already added, they are not re-created. % S = ndi . session . dir ( ref , dirname ); vhlabdevnames = ndi . setup . daq . system . vhlab (); % returns list of daq system names for i = 1 : numel ( vhlabdevnames ), dev = S . daqsystem_load ( 'name' , vhlabdevnames { i }); if isempty ( dev ), S = ndi . setup . daq . system . vhlab ( S , vhlabdevnames { i }); end end % update SYNCGRAPH nsf = ndi . time . syncrule . filematch ( struct ( 'number_fullpath_matches' , 2 )); n_intan2spike2 = ndi . time . syncrule . filefind ( struct ( 'number_fullpath_matches' , 1 , ... 'syncfilename' , 'vhintan_intan2spike2time.txt' , ... 'daqsystem1' , 'vhintan' , 'daqsystem2' , 'vhvis_spike2' )); S . syncgraph_addrule ( nsf ); S . syncgraph_addrule ( n_intan2spike2 ); This function calls another function that we will see in a minute ( ndi.setup.daq.system.vhlab ) that actually builds the daq system objects that we use in our lab. At the end of this function, 2 ndi.time.syncrules are added that describe how synchronization is performed across our devices. If 2 or more of the same files are present in an epoch, then it is assumed that files are from the same underlying device and they are assumed to have the same time clock. Our custom acquisition code also produces a file vhintan_intan2spike2time.txt that has the time shift and scaling between our Intan acquisition system and our CED Spike2 acquisition system, and we instruct NDI to use that file to synchronize the 2 devices using shift and scale in that file. 2.2.4 Creating a function that creates the daq systems for a lab \u00b6 We also write a function that builds the daq systems that we use in our lab. This process involves 1) naming the daq system, 2) specifying the ndi.daq.reader that is used, 3) specifying any ndi.daq.metadatareader if necessary, and 4) specifying the ndi.file.navigator to find the files that comprise each epoch. If this function here is called with 0 input arguments, then it returns a list of all known daq systems objects for our lab ( 'vhintan', 'vhspike2', 'vhvis_spike2' ). Otherwise, if it is called with the name of a daq system that this function knows how to build, it builds it. It adds the appropriate ndi.daq.reader , ndi.daq.metadatareader , and ndi.file.navigator . Code block 2.2.4.1: Content of +ndi/+setup/+daq/+system/vhlab.m . (Do not type into Matlab command line.) \u00b6 function S = vhlab ( S, daqsystemname ) % ndi.setup.daq.system.vhlab - initialize daq systems used by VHLAB % % S = ndi.setup.daq.system.vhlab(S, DEVNAME) % % Creates daq systems that look for files in the VHLAB standard recording % scheme, where data from different epochs are organized into % subdirectories (using ndi.file.navigator.epochdir).

These files are produced by the computer that runs our main acquisition on our rigs, when an Intan acquisition device is used. Together, reference.txt and vhintan_channelgrouping.txt have information about the probes that were used in that recording and the channel mapping of those probes. We will look at these in more detail later. We use the reader ndi.daq.reader.mfdaq.intan , which knows how to read channel data from Intan .rhd files. We tell our daq.system object that 'vhintan_channelgrouping.txt' is the file to use to read epochprobemap information (we will instruct it how to interpret the data in a later function), and there is no metadata reader mdr . We also tell ndi.file.navigator that all of these files will appear in subfolders within our main folder by using the ndi.file.navigator.epochdir class. vhspike2 - This daq system is very similar to vhintan , except that it looks for files that end in .smr and looks for a different epochmap metadata file ( vhspike2_channelgrouping.txt ). vhvis_spike2 - This system is more custom. It relies on text files that are generated by our scripts that run on our CED Micro1401 acquisition system: stimtimes.txt , verticalblanking.txt , spike2data.smr , and a file generated by our visual stimulation system called stims.mat . We add a metadatareader ndi.daq.metadatareader.NewStimStims that knows how to interpret the stims.mat file. We will cover this custom ndi.daq.reader next. 2.2.5 Creating a custom ndi.daq.reader.mfdaq.stimulus object: \u00b6 Our visual stimulation system produces a variety of event data, including information about stimulus onset and offset, the vertical refresh signal from the monitor, an 8-bit code for each stimulus ID, a video frame trigger (every time we update the image on the screen), and a signal we call the \"pretime\" trigger that is generally issued 0.5 seconds before a stimulus is begun (used for baseline subtracting in intrinsic signal imaging experiments among other applications). Our acquisition system running on a CED Micro1401 generates text files related to these events, and we propagate them through as a set of event channels. We define 5 fixed channels for our daq system: mk1 : a marker channel that indicates stim ON (+1) or stim OFF (-1) mk2 : a marker channel that indicates the 8-bit stimulus identifier (stimid) mk3 : a marker channel that indicates when the stimulus period opens (+1) and closes (-1); this includes interstimulus \"background\" time e1 : an event channel that indicates each frame trigger / video frame update e2 : an event channel that indicates the vertical refresh times of the stimulus monitor e3 : an event channel that indicates the pre-stimulus trigger (indicates stimulus is upcoming, usually 0.5s away) Rather than copying the entire code here, we will include a link to the file: ndi.setup.daq.reader.mfdaq.stimulus.vhlabvisspike2.m . It should be relatively self-explanitory for someone with a coding background to read and mimic this file. 2.2.6 Creating a custom epochprobemap class \u00b6 In Tutorial 2.1 , we saw that each epoch of data had an associated epochprobemap that contained the following fields of information: name reference type devicestring subjectstring ctx 1 n-trode ced_daqsystem:ai11 treeshrew_12345@mylab.org vis_stim 1 stimulator vis_daqsystem:mk30;text30;md1 treeshrew_12345@mylab.org We need to write a substitute class that is a subclass of ndi.epoch.epochprobemap that reads the epoch information and returns all of this same information. In our vhlab session directories, we always have a single subject whose unique identifier is specified in a text file called subject.txt in the top directory. This file is read, and this text is used as the subjectstring for all probes. In each vhlab epoch directory, we have a file called reference.txt that includes the name, reference, and type of recording present in each epoch. Our class's creator reads this file, and uses it to pull out the name and reference number for all electrode (or imaging) probes. If our reference.txt file indicates that our vhlab \"type\" is singleEC (single extracellular) or 'ntrode', then it looks for other text files that contain a mapping between the name and reference of each probe and the channels that were used on a recording device to acquire it. In this experiment, we have vhspike2_channelgrouping.txt that indicates that our probe 'ctx | 1' was acquired on channel 11 of our CED Micro1401/Spike2 system. Finally, if a file named stimtimes.txt exists in the epoch directory, then we add in an epochprobemap entry for our visual stimulator: name reference type devicestring subjectstring vis_stim 1 stimulator vhvis_spike2:mk1-3;e1-3;md1 treeshrew_12345@mylab.org We will not reproduce the code here but refer the reader to the link for the source code of the class ndi.setup.epoch.epochprobemap_daqsystem_vhlab that is a subclass of ndi.epoch.epochprobemap_daqsystem . 2.2.7 Putting it all together \u00b6 Now that we have these pieces together, we can read our example data that we call ts_exper2 . We will pull up the same plots that we pulled up in Tutorial 2.1 . Code block 2.2.7.1 Type this into Matlab \u00b6 prefix = [ userpath filesep 'Documents' filesep 'NDI' ]; % if you put the folder somewhere else, edit this S = ndi . setup . vhlab ( 'ts_exper2' ,[ prefix filesep 'ts_exper2' ]); p_ctx1_list = S . getprobes ( 'name' , 'ctx' , 'reference' , 1 ) % returns a cell array of matches p_ctx1 = p_ctx1_list { 1 }; % take the first one, should be the only one epoch_to_read = 1 ; [ data , t , timeref_p_ctx1 ]= p_ctx1 . readtimeseries ( epoch_to_read , - Inf , Inf ); % read all data from epoch 1 figure ( 100 ); plot ( t , data ); xlabel ( 'Time(s)' ); ylabel ( 'Voltage (V)' ); set ( gca , 'xlim' ,[ t ( 1 ) t ( end )]); box off ; p_visstim_list = S . getprobes ( 'type' , 'stimulator' ) % returns a cell array of matches p_visstim = p_visstim_list { 1 }; % take the first one, should be the only one [ data , t , timeref_stim ]= p_visstim . readtimeseries ( timeref_p_ctx1 , - Inf , Inf ); % read all data from epoch 1 of p_ctx1 ! figure ( 100 ); hold on ; vlt . neuro . stimulus . plot_stimulus_timeseries ( 7 , t . stimon , t . stimoff , 'stimid' , data . stimid ); If you are paying close attention, you'll notice we got a little more information out of the readtimeseries command here. t.stimoff exists (it's extracted from our stimulus metadata), so we don't have to know the stimulus duration from elsewhere. That information is not directly accessible in the event record of the smr file, so there is an advantage to reading all the metadata that is available from all sources with a custom object. 2.2.8 Discussion/Feedback \u00b6 This concludes our tutorial on setting up code files to read one's own data and metadata into NDI. To help make this process clearer, we also include 3 other case studies in reading data (tutorials currently under construction): Alessandra Angelluci lab (reads unpublished recording) Don Katz lab (reads Mukherjee et al., 2019 ) Eve Marder lab (reads Hamood et al., 2015 ) Post comments, bugs, questions, or discuss .","title":"2.2 Automating data reading with NDI"},{"location":"tutorials/analyzing_first_physiology_experiment/2_theautomatedway/#tutorial-2-analyzing-your-first-electrophysiology-experiment-with-ndi","text":"","title":"Tutorial 2: Analyzing your first electrophysiology experiment with NDI"},{"location":"tutorials/analyzing_first_physiology_experiment/2_theautomatedway/#22-automating-the-reading-of-data-from-your-rig-or-lab-or-collaborator","text":"In the previous tutorial, we reviewed the steps necessary to create ndi.daq.system objects to read in a dataset, and to add the metadata that is necessary to tell NDI about the contents of each epoch.

These files are produced by the computer that runs our main acquisition on our rigs, when an Intan acquisition device is used. Together, reference.txt and vhintan_channelgrouping.txt have information about the probes that were used in that recording and the channel mapping of those probes. We will look at these in more detail later. We use the reader ndi.daq.reader.mfdaq.intan , which knows how to read channel data from Intan .rhd files. We tell our daq.system object that 'vhintan_channelgrouping.txt' is the file to use to read epochprobemap information (we will instruct it how to interpret the data in a later function), and there is no metadata reader mdr . We also tell ndi.file.navigator that all of these files will appear in subfolders within our main folder by using the ndi.file.navigator.epochdir class. vhspike2 - This daq system is very similar to vhintan , except that it looks for files that end in .smr and looks for a different epochmap metadata file ( vhspike2_channelgrouping.txt ). vhvis_spike2 - This system is more custom. It relies on text files that are generated by our scripts that run on our CED Micro1401 acquisition system: stimtimes.txt , verticalblanking.txt , spike2data.smr , and a file generated by our visual stimulation system called stims.mat . We add a metadatareader ndi.daq.metadatareader.NewStimStims that knows how to interpret the stims.mat file.

Our acquisition system running on a CED Micro1401 generates text files related to these events, and we propagate them through as a set of event channels. We define 5 fixed channels for our daq system: mk1 : a marker channel that indicates stim ON (+1) or stim OFF (-1) mk2 : a marker channel that indicates the 8-bit stimulus identifier (stimid) mk3 : a marker channel that indicates when the stimulus period opens (+1) and closes (-1); this includes interstimulus \"background\" time e1 : an event channel that indicates each frame trigger / video frame update e2 : an event channel that indicates the vertical refresh times of the stimulus monitor e3 : an event channel that indicates the pre-stimulus trigger (indicates stimulus is upcoming, usually 0.5s away) Rather than copying the entire code here, we will include a link to the file: ndi.setup.daq.reader.mfdaq.stimulus.vhlabvisspike2.m .

Now suppose we want to do some analysis of this data? How would we do it? Clearly, one could write functions in Matlab that read the data and perform some sort of analysis. But it would be great to share (or borrow) those functions across the open source community, and to develop \"apps\" that excel at performing specific tasks. NDI allows both approaches. Tutorial 2.3.1: What is an 'app' in NDI? ndi.app objects \u00b6 An app for our purposes is any application program that can read data from NDI and perform some analysis or computation on this data. Some apps exist outside of NDI, and know how to read data from NDI experiments and write results back to NDI experimental sessions. One example of such an app is the spike sorting program JRClust. There is another set of apps that are developed specifically for NDI that are members of a special parent class called ndi.app . This parent class performs some services to help app developers maintain a consistant approach to make it easier for users and programmers that want to use the app to easily figure out what it does and how to use it. Here, we will examine one of these apps that we made for spike extraction. Just like Windows computers come with NotePad and Mac computers come with TextEdit, our ndi.app.spikeextractor is a plain-but-usable program for extracting spike waveforms from voltage records. It is suitable for spike extraction situations where the channel count for each electrode is low, such as single electrodes or tetrodes. It is not suitable for dense, multichannel electrodes like NeuroPixels or dense NeuroNexus probes. We will use the program first as though we knew how to use it by magic, and then we will go through how one could figure out how to use the program if one didn't know.

Neurophys. , 2000). As a first step, we will create a sorting parameters document to specify how we will perform the sorting. This program includes a small graphical user interface to help in choosing the clusters (called in the line that has ssa.spike_sort ). For a quick video demo of how to use this graphical user interface in the context of this tutorial, click here .

How could we learn how to use a new app if there isn't a tutorial available? There are three great ways to learn about what apps do and how to use them. Read the main documentation for the app by typing help *appclass* or doc *appclass* into the Matlab command line. For example, try help ndi.app.spikeextractor . Many apps follow what we call the appdoc convention for creating the documents that they create and loading the documents and data that they have generated. This is a convention that have developed relatively recently, and we are in the process of converting all of our included ndi.app objects to use this form. If an app follows ndi.app.appdoc (which means it is a member of the ndi.app.appdoc class), then they will have a set of methods called: Method Description appdoc_description The help information should have a full description of all database documents that are produced by the application. Type help *appname*/appdoc_description . For example, help ndi.app.spikeextractor/appdoc_description add_appdoc Add a new document of a given type to the database, using the app clear_appdoc Delete a document of a given type from the database, using the app find_appdoc Find the NDI document for a given type, using the app loaddata_appdoc Load binary data associated with an NDI document, using the app Let's look at the document types that are written and needed by ndi.app.spikeextractor : Code block 2.3.4.1. Type this into Matlab \u00b6 help ndi . app . spikeextractor / appdoc_description You see a long bit of text that describes all of the document types that are generated and calculated by ndi.app.spikeextractor . Here's a table of the document types and their \"about\" info for ndi.app.spikeextractor: Appdoc Type Description EXTRACTION_PARAMETERS EXTRACTION_PARAMETERS documents hold the parameters that are to be used to guide the extraction of spikewaves EXTRACTION_PARAMETERS_MODIFICATION EXTRACTION_PARAMETERS_MODIFICATION documents allow the user to modify the spike extraction parameters for a specific epoch SPIKEWAVES SPIKEWAVES documents store the spike waveforms that are read during a spike extraction.

Now we will employ another plain app for calculating responses to stimulation. 2.4.1 Sinusoidal gratings to assess direction and orientation preferences and spatial frequency preferences \u00b6 In this experiment ( Van Hooser et al. 2013 ), we assessed tuning for stimulus direction and spatial frequency with sinusoidal gratings. A series of sinusoidal gratings drifting in different directions are shown here . In the actual experiments, we assessed orientation/direction preferences coarsely, and then found the optimal spatial and temporal frequency for the cell before assessing orientation/direction in a fine manner at the optimal spatial and temporal frequency for the cell. The fine orientation/direction assessment is what is included in this demo. So let's open our demo experiment and get started! We are also going to identify our stimulator (visual stimulus system) so that we can tell NDI to analyze stimuli from this device. Code Block 2.4.1.1. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 dirname = [ userpath filesep 'Documents' filesep 'NDI' filesep 'ts_exper2' ]; % change this if you put the example somewhere else ref = 'ts_exper2' ; S = ndi . session . dir ( ref , dirname ); % find out stimulus probe stimprobe = S . getprobes ( 'type' , 'stimulator' ); stimprobe = stimprobe { 1 }; % grab the first one, should be our stimulus monitor 2.4.2 Gathering stimulus information \u00b6 The first step in analyzing stimuli is to gather information about the stimulus presentations that were performed in the experiment. We use a small dedicated app for this purpose called ndi.app.stimulus.decoder . Code Block 2.4.2.1. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 sapp = ndi . app . stimulus . decoder ( S ); redo = 1 ; [ stim_pres_docs ] = sapp . parse_stimuli ( stimprobe , redo ); Now let's take a look at what has been decoded: Code Block 2.4.2.2. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 stim_pres_docs { 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_presentation % these are the fields that were decoded by ndi.app.stimulus.decoder % let's take a look % here is information about the presentation time of the first stimulus stim_pres_docs { 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_presentation . presentation_time ( 1 ) % here is information about the presentation order of the first 10 stimuli shown: stim_pres_docs { 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_presentation . presentation_order ( 1 : 10 ) % We see that the first stimulus that was presented was stimulus number 4.

For visual stimuli, this is often a period where a gray screen is shown that has the same duration as the visual stimuli that may be shown. For an auditory stimulus, it may be a period of time when no specific auditory stimulus is playing and the animal hears the noise of the background environment. Often, stimuli have in their parameters a field that declares that a stimulus is a control or blank stimulus. Our stimuli have such a code as shown above (stimulus 17). Code Block 2.4.3.1. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 rapp = ndi . app . stimulus . tuning_response ( S ); cs_doc = rapp . label_control_stimuli ( stimprobe , redo ); Let's examine what it did. We see that the ndi.app.stimuli.tuning_response app each of the 85 stimuli with the \"blank\" stimulus that was presented closest in time: Code Block 2.4.3.2. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 % see the control stimulus identifier for all the stimuli cs_doc { 1 }. document_properties . control_stimulus_ids . control_stimulus_ids % see the method used to identify the control stimulus for each stimulus: cs_doc { 1 }. document_properties . control_stimulus_ids . control_stimulus_id_method % see the help for the label_control_stimuli function: help ndi . app . stimulus . tuning_response . label_control_stimuli 2.4.4 Calculating stimulus responses \u00b6 Once the control stimuli have been labeled (if desired; it is optional), then one can proceed to calcuate the stimulus responses. To do this, we can employ the [ndi.app.stimuli.tuning_response]((https://vh-lab.github.io/NDI-matlab/reference/%2Bndi/%2Bapp/%2Bstimulus/tuning_response.m/) app. This program will calculate the mean response to each stimulus. Because gratings are a periodic stimulus, this function will also calculate the response at the fundamental stimulus temporal frequency (F1 component) and at twice this temporal frequency (F2 component). Code block 2.4.4.1. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 e = S . getelements ( 'element.type' , 'spikes' ); rdocs { 1 } = rapp . stimulus_responses ( stimprobe , e { 1 }, redo ); rdocs { 2 } = rapp . stimulus_responses ( stimprobe , e { 2 }, redo ); Now we can examine the sets of documents that are produced. We see that there are two sets of 3 documents each: Code block 2.4.4.2. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 % look at rdocs{1}: rdocs { 1 } % it is a 1x2 cell array, and each of these cell entries is in turn a 1x3 cell array rdocs { 1 }{ 1 } % this reflects the two epochs ('t00001' and 't00002'), and, for each epoch, the analysis of the mean response, the F1 component, and the F2 component % to see this, let's look at the first document rdocs { 1 }{ 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties rdocs { 1 }{ 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_response rdocs { 1 }{ 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_response_scalar % we see that this is the 'mean' response. We can see the responses contained within: rdocs { 1 }{ 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_response_scalar . responses % we can see that each of the 85 presentations includes a response that can possibly have a real and imaginary component, as well as a control response rdocs { 1 }{ 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_response_scalar . responses . response_real ( 1 ) rdocs { 1 }{ 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_response_scalar . responses . control_response_real ( 1 ) 2.4.5 Computing an orientation/direction tuning curve and calculating orientation/direction index values \u00b6 Now that we have all of the responses to the individual stimuli, we can create a tuning curve, which examines how the response of the neuron depends on a particular stimulus parameter. In this case, the stimulus is 'angle', which corresponds to the direction of the sinusoidal grating stimulus. We have built a specific application ndi.app.oridirtuning to process tuning curves in response to oriented stimuli, or stimuli moving in particular directions. After generating the tuning curve, we can calculate many, many index values that characterize the tuning of each cell. The function that calculates the orientation and direction index values pulls up a plot. If you look at the plot that examines the mean response for ctx_1 , you can see that the cell responds strongly to gratings drifting at 120 degrees and 300 degrees (0 degrees is up; 90 degrees is to the right). Code block 2.4.5.1. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 oapp = ndi . app . oridirtuning ( S ); for i = 1 : 2 , tdoc { i } = oapp . calculate_tuning_curve ( e { i }); oriprops { i } = oapp . calculate_all_oridir_indexes ( e { i }); % this takes a few minutes end ; Now let's take a look at these index values for the first cell. These index values are described in Mazurek et al. (2014) . Code block 2.4.5.2. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 % see all the categories oriprops { 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties . orientation_direction_tuning % see the property information oriprops { 1 }{ 1 }. document_properties . orientation_direction_tuning . properties % see significance.

This database holds the ndi.document objects that contain the metadata and data results of calculations that apps and programs have performed on the original data.

Here we see that ndi.document objects have a property called document_properties that contains all of the text information that is stored in the document. We will look through all of these properties here, and we also direct you to the documentation page for the ndi.document class stimulus_presentation . 2.5.2 All ndi.document objects have the fields document_class and ndi_document . \u00b6 The document_class fields contain critical information about the class, such as the file that contains its definition, its full class name and its short class name. In addition, document types can be composed of multiple document types. The stimulus presentation class has two superclasses: ndi.document and ndi.document_epochid . This means that a stimulus_presentation document has its own fields, plus all of the fields from ndi.document documents and and ndi.document_epochid documents. Let's look at the data that specifies the superclasses: Code block 2.5.1.3. Type this into Matlab. \u00b6 stim_pres_doc { 1 }. document_properties . document_class % % ans = % struct with fields: % definition: '$NDIDOCUMENTPATH/stimulus/stimulus_presentation.json' % validation: '$NDISCHEMAPATH/stimulus/stimulus_presentation_schema.json' % class_name: 'ndi_document_stimulus_stimulus_presentation' % property_list_name: 'stimulus_presentation' % class_version: 1 % superclasses: [3x1 struct] stim_pres_doc { 1 }. document_properties . document_class . superclasses ( 1 ) % ans = % struct with fields: % definition: '$NDIDOCUMENTPATH/ndi_document.json' stim_pres_doc { 1 }. document_properties . document_class . superclasses ( 2 ) % ans = % struct with fields: % definition: '$NDIDOCUMENTPATH/ndi_document_epochid.json' stim_pres_doc { 1 }. document_properties . document_class . superclasses ( 3 ) %ans = % struct with fields: % definition: '$NDIDOCUMENTPATH/ndi_document.json' All documents have ndi_document as a superclass. Note that ndi.document is the name of the software object in Matlab (and Python), whereas ndi_document is the name of the database object type that has the following fields: field default_value data type description session_id - NDI ID string The globally unique identifier of any data session that produced this document id - NDI ID string The globally unique identifier of this document name character array (ASCII) A user-specified name, free for users/developers to use as they like type character array (ASCII) A user-specified type, free for users/developers to use as they like (deprecated, will be removed) datestamp (current time) ISO-8601 date string, time zone must be UTC leap seconds Time of document creation database_version - character array (ASCII) Version of this document in the database The most useful item in each ndi.document is its unique identifier id . This is a globally unique identifier, which means that no other ndi.document or corresponding ndi_document anywhere in the universe has the same identifier. It is constructed of two hexidecimal strings: the first is based on the time of creation in Universal Controlled Time (UTC), and the second is created by a random number generator. This constructions means that ndi.document ids are not only unique, but also that sorting them alphabetically will give you the creation order of the documents.

The object ndi.query allows one to express database searches. Let's learn about ndi.query with a few examples. % search for document classes that contain the string 'stim' q_stim = ndi . query ( 'document_class.class_name' , 'contains_string' , 'stim' , '' ); stim_docs = S . database_search ( q_stim ) % returns 35 matches for me % now suppose we also want to search for documents that were made by % our app ndi_app_stimulus_decoder: q_stim_decoder = ndi . query ( 'app.name' , 'exact_string' , 'ndi_app_stimulus_decoder' , '' ); % we can find based on this criteria alone... stim_decoder_docs = S . database_search ( q_stim_decoder ) % returns 4 matches for me % ...or we can put the search terms together in an AND to demand both queries are satisfied q_stim_and_stim_decoder_docs = S . database_search ( q_stim_decoder & q_stim ); % returns 4 matches for me, because all q_stim_decoder docs have 'stimulus' in the class_name % we can also put queries together into a single variable: q_or = q_stim_decoder | q_stim ; q_and = q_stim_decoder & q_stim ; q_stim_and_stim_decoder_docs = S . database_search ( q_and ) % produces the same as above % now we can inspect these documents: q_stim_and_stim_decoder_docs { 1 }. document_properties % ans = % struct with fields: % app: [1x1 struct] % depends_on: [1x1 struct] % document_class: [1x1 struct] % epochid: 't00001' % epochid_fix: [1x1 struct] % ndi_document: [1x1 struct] % stimulus_presentation: [1x1 struct] q_stim_and_stim_decoder_docs { 1 }. document_properties . app % for me: % ans = % struct with fields: % name: 'ndi_app_stimulus_decoder' % version: 'fa1fa7818b215975c43f68ece523b065852ef891' % url: 'https://github.com/VH-Lab/NDI-matlab' % os: 'MACI64' % os_version: '10.14.6' % interpreter: 'MATLAB' % interpreter_version: '9.8' q_stim_and_stim_decoder_docs { 1 }. document_properties . stimulus_presentation % ans = % struct with fields: % presentation_order: [85x1 double] % presentation_time: [85x1 struct] % stimuli: [17x1 struct] The different possible search terms for ndi.query objects is shown below: NDI_QUERY_OBJ = ndi . query ( FIELD , OPERATION , PARAM1 , PARAM2 ) Operation Description 'regexp' are there any regular expression matches between the field value and 'param1' ?

Probes, subjects, elements, DAQ systems \u00b6 We define a probe as an instrument that makes a measurement of or produces a stimulus for a subject . In this framework, a variety of experimental apparatus are considered probes . Examples of probes that make measurements include a whole cell pipette, a sharp electrode, a single channel extracellular electrode, multichannel electrodes with either known or unknown geometries, cameras, 2-photon microscopes, fMRI machines, nose-poke detectors, EMG electrodes, and EEG electrodes. Examples of probes that provide stimulation are odor ports, valve-driven interaural cannulae, food reward dispensers, visual stimulus monitors, audio speakers, and stimulating electrodes. A probe requires two important connections. The first connection is with a subject . This subject can be an experimental research animal, a human subject, a set of cells in a dish, a test resistor, the air, a potato, anything, but it must be named and given an identifier in NDI. The second important connection of a probe is to a data acquisition system that stores the measurements or the stimulation history of the probe . We term such a system a DAQ system . Each time a DAQ system is switched into record mode, an epoch of data is recorded. Probes are part of a broader class of experiment items that we term elements , which include concrete physical objects like probes but also inferred objects that are not observed directly, such as neurons in an extracellular recording experiment, or abstract quantities, such as simulated data, or a model of the information that an animal has about a stimulus at a given time. Real world vocabulary \u00b6 An example experiment. A probe is any instrument that can make a measurement from or provide stimulation to a subject . In this case, an electrode with an amplifier is monitoring signals in cerebral cortex of a ferret and the electrode is a probe and the ferret is a subject . A DAQ system is an instrument that digitally logs the measurements or stimulus history of a probe . In this case, a data acquisition system (DAQ) is logging the voltage values produced by the electrode's amplifier and storing the results in a file on a computer. An epoch is an interval of time during which a DAQ system is switched on and then off to make a recording. In this case, 3 epochs have been sampled. The experiment has additional experiment elements . One of these elements is a filtered version of the electrode data. A second element is a neuron, whose existence and spike times have been inferred by a spike analysis application and recorded in the experiment. Real world vocabulary: elements \u00b6 In NDI, a wide variety of experiment items are called elements , of which probes are a subset. Examples of probes include multi-channel extracellular electrodes, reward wells, 2-photon microscopes, intrinsic signal imaging systems, intracellular or extracellular single electrodes, and visual stimulus monitors. Other elements include items that are directly linked to probes , such as filtered versions of signals, or inferred objects like neurons whose activity are inferred from extracellular recordings or images. Still other elements have no physical derivation, such as artificial data or purely simulated data; nevertheless, we want to be able to treat these items identically in analysis pipelines. Finally, elements might be the result of complex modeling that depends on many other experiment elements , such as an inferred phenomenological model of the amount of information that an animal has about whether a stimulus is a grating. Real world vocabulary: DAQ systems \u00b6 DAQ systems digitally record probe measurements or histories of stimulator activity. In NDI, DAQ systems are logical entities, which could correspond physically to a single DAQ device made by a particular company (top), or a collection of home-brewed devices that operate together to have the behavior of a single DAQ device (bottom). In the bottom example, information from an electrode probe and digital triggers from a visual stimulation probe are acquired on a single DAQ device, but digital information from both systems (in separate files) is needed to fully describe the activity in each epoch.

A second element is a neuron, whose existence and spike times have been inferred by a spike analysis application and recorded in the experiment.","title":"Real world vocabulary"},{"location":"tutorials/ndimodel/2_ndimodel_vocabulary/#real-world-vocabulary-elements","text":"In NDI, a wide variety of experiment items are called elements , of which probes are a subset. Examples of probes include multi-channel extracellular electrodes, reward wells, 2-photon microscopes, intrinsic signal imaging systems, intracellular or extracellular single electrodes, and visual stimulus monitors. Other elements include items that are directly linked to probes , such as filtered versions of signals, or inferred objects like neurons whose activity are inferred from extracellular recordings or images. Still other elements have no physical derivation, such as artificial data or purely simulated data; nevertheless, we want to be able to treat these items identically in analysis pipelines. Finally, elements might be the result of complex modeling that depends on many other experiment elements , such as an inferred phenomenological model of the amount of information that an animal has about whether a stimulus is a grating.","title":"Real world vocabulary: elements"},{"location":"tutorials/ndimodel/2_ndimodel_vocabulary/#real-world-vocabulary-daq-systems","text":"DAQ systems digitally record probe measurements or histories of stimulator activity.

In the bottom example, information from an electrode probe and digital triggers from a visual stimulation probe are acquired on a single DAQ device, but digital information from both systems (in separate files) is needed to fully describe the activity in each epoch.","title":"Real world vocabulary: DAQ systems"},{"location":"tutorials/ndimodel/2_ndimodel_vocabulary/#discussionfeedback","text":"Post comments, bugs, questions, or discuss .","title":"Discussion/Feedback"},{"location":"under_construction/EXAMPLE_USES/","text":"5 examples of recording situations \u00b6 1. Simple: 1 device, 1 probe, 3 things \u00b6 An experimentor records spontaneously generated responses with a single intracellular electrode inserted in visual cortex. The analyst wants to examine the spiking responses of the neuron and the voltage responses of the neuron with the spiking artificially removed. Physical situation : There is a single physical hardware data acquisition system, in this case a system made by Cambridge Electronic Deisgn called the micro1401. A wire connects the electrode to an amplifier, and a wire from the amplifier connects to an input (let's say input 0) on the micro1401. The recording system is turned on to record a bout of spontaneous activity, and then turned off. Each time the recording is turned on, a file (.smr format) is written to disk. The software that manages the recording of the micro1401 is written by CED and is called Spike2. Let's say there are 3 recording epochs. Therefore, we have 3 .smr files (let's say at path epoch1/myfile.smr, epoch2/myotherfile.smr, epoch3/myotherfileagain.smr). NDI configuration : The raw data is managed by a member of the class ndi_daqsystem . There is a subclass, ndi_daqsystem_mfdaq , that implements a generic multi-function data acquisition system, which is a system that has analog inputs, analog outputs (which are records of signals that were output), digital inputs, digital outputs, and a clock. There is an ndi_daqreader_mfdaq class, and a specific subclass ndi_daqreader_mfdaq_cedspike2 that implements the reading of the .smr files. We build an ndi_daqsystem object to add to the ndi_experiment object of this experiment, that we will call vhspike2 (for reading the electrode data). To do so, we need to create the 2 component objects of an ndi_daqsystem : an ndi_daqreader and an ndi_filenavigator . Let's say our experiment is in variable E. fileparams = ; d = ndi_daqsystem_mfdaq(ndi_daqreader_mfdaq_cedspike2(), ndi_filenavigator(fileparams)); Now we can ask the device what epochs it has. et = d.epochtable(); When we do this, the device asks its file_navigator to determine the epochs that it has (calling the file_navigator's epochtable() method), which searches the disk for occurrences of .smr files. If we study the epochtable that is returned, we see that it has 3 entries. et et(1) Each of these entries has a field underlying that allows us to examine the underlying details of the epoch. et(1).underlying The ndi_epochset class defines data structures and methods that manage these interdependent epochs. Each ndi_daqsystem has epochs that depend on the epochs of a file_navigator. ndi_probe objects have epochs that depend on the epochs of the underlying device that recorded the probe. An ndi_thing object is related to the epochs of the probe that provided evidence for it (although in the future we want to be able to define ndi_thing objects that are not necessarily related to a probe). We also create ndi_thing objects that are related to the data that is directly sampled from a probe. In this example, we create a direct thing that is equal to the data sampled from the probe (the raw voltage of the sampled data) and 2 indirect (or not direct ) probes whose epochs are created from data that is derived from the probe. In the first case, we create a list of spike times by detecting the spike events in the waveform, and, in the second, we create filtered version of the data with the spike waveforms clipped out. 2.
