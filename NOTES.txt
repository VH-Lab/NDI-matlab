Need to do these things to support new DID database:

a) modify use of writing to binary files so the binary files are made before
   the documents are added to the database
b) modify schema so they conform to DID-database and use base instead of ndi_document
c) modify ndi.document so it operates with base instead of ndi_document
d) modify ndi.database implementations so it uses did sql
e) test the code to make sure all test cases pass

Where are 

a)

ndi.session:
	line 337, documentation update  *

ndi.app.spikeextractor: 
	line 186 *
	line 188 *
	check lines 437, 458  * (reading)

ndi.app.spikesorter: 
	line 231 *

ndi.element.timeseries:  * 
	line 102 (needs to write timepoints, datapoints before adding to database; element epoch schema needs to be updated for file)

ndi.test.database.test_ndi_document:
	line 48 * but will fail when schema validation turned on; would have
		failed anyway, needs new document type


c) update ndi.document so merges file names
