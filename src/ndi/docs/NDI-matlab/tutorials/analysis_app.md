# Making your own analysis app that uses NDI

This is planned tutorial.

We will design a simple application that analyzes responses of taste stimuli, and take the user/developer through the process of design, creating database document types, writing, and testing.

This is targeted to be written in the first 6 months of application R01MH126791 (if funded) or earlier if time permits.
