## Introduction

The Neuroscience Data Interface (NDI) is a software tool for reading neuroscience data and storing analyses and analyses of analyses in a database. Rather than requiring data to be stored in a particular way, NDI allows the user to specify the formats of the data to be read and its organization scheme, and the user retrieves parts of the data through the NDI application program interface. The database stores documents with both human-readable and binary components, so that complex data pipelines (analyses, and analyses of analyses) can be stored and searched. NDI allows an application ecosystem where applications can focus on calculations rather than data format or organization.

In order to understand NDI and how to use it, it is important to understand 2 concepts:

- [1.2 NDI concepts and vocabulary](2_ndimodel_vocabulary.md)
- 1.3 NDI software objects (to be built)
