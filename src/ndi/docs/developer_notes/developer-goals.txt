Needs to have a conceptually clear logical interface (analogies: probes, daqsystems, epochs, database)

Needs to be independent of platform

Desired to install in 1 step on any platform by a novice

Needs to be easy to run on Mac, Linux, Windows

Functionality should be separate from implementation (for example, database properties should not just be determined by the software that implements it; should be a layer so that we can have flexibility to switch underlying implementing software if open source winds change)
