    % NDI.TIME.TIMEMAPPING - class for managing mapping of time across epochs and devices
    %
    % Describes mapping from one time base to another. The base class, ndi.time.timemapping, provides
    % polynomial mapping, although usually only linear mapping is used.
    % The property MAPPING is a vector of length N+1 that describes the coefficients of a
    % polynomial such that:
    %
    % t_out = mapping(1)*t_in^N + mapping(2)*t_in^(N-1) + ... mapping(N)*t_in + mapping(N+1)
    %
    % Usually, one specifies a linear relationship only, with MAPPING = [scale shift] so that
    %
    % t_out = scale * t_in + shift
    %

    properties (SetAccess=protected,GetAccess=public)
