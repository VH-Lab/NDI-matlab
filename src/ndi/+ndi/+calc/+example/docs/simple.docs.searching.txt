By default, this ndi.calc.example.simple object looks for all probes in the experiment, and creates an output document that depends on that probe with the answer value requested.

If one wished to restrict this further, one might add an additional condition to the default query.

Example:
% Only perform the operation on the probe called 'myprobe'

DQ = c.default_search_for_input_parameters();
DQ.query = DQ.query & ndi.query('element.name','exact_string','myprobe','');
c.run('Replace',DQ);
