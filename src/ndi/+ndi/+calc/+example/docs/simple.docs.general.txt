The simple calculator is a demonstration calculator used to illustrate the structure and implementation of an ndi.calculator object.

It accepts a single input parameter 'answer' and creates an output document where the property 'answer' is set to this input value. This serves as a minimal example of passing parameters and generating output documents with dependencies.

Methodology:
The calculator performs a direct assignment:
output.answer = input_parameters.answer

This calculator is primarily intended for testing and educational purposes.
