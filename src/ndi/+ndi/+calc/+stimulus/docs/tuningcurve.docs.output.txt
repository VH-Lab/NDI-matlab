Document Type: tuningcurve_calc
Superclasses: ndi.document, stimulus_tuningcurve

Fields Description:
The output document contains the calculated tuning curve data and the parameters used to generate it.

Properties:

1. tuningcurve_calc:
   - input_parameters: The configuration structure used for the calculation.
       - independent_label: Label(s) for the x-axis (e.g., 'Contrast').
       - independent_parameter: Parameter name(s) corresponding to the labels (e.g., 'contrast').
       - best_algorithm: Algorithm used for 'best' selection (e.g., 'empirical_maximum').
       - selection: Structure array of selection criteria used to filter stimuli.
   - log: A log string recording operations performed, such as specific values selected as 'best' or 'greatest'.
   - stim_property_list: (If 'deal' was used)
       - names: Names of the parameters that were dealt to create this specific document.
       - values: The specific values of the dealt parameters for this document.

2. stimulus_tuningcurve (Inherited):
   This structure contains the core tuning curve data.

   - Tuning Curve Data:
       - independent_variable_label: Cell array of labels for the independent variables (e.g., {'Contrast'}).
       - independent_variable_value: Matrix of values for the independent variables. Rows correspond to data points.
       - response_mean: Vector containing the mean response for each unique condition of the independent variable(s).
       - response_stddev: Vector containing the standard deviation of the responses for each condition.
       - response_stderr: Vector containing the standard error of the mean for each condition.
       - response_units: String describing the units of the response (e.g., 'Spikes/s').

   - Individual Trial Data:
       - individual_responses_real: Cell array where each element is a vector of the real components of individual trial responses for that condition.
       - individual_responses_imaginary: Cell array where each element is a vector of the imaginary components of individual trial responses for that condition.
       - stimulus_presentation_number: Indices of the stimulus presentations contributing to each point.
       - stimid: The stimulus ID associated with each point.

   - Control/Baseline Data:
       - control_response_mean: The mean response to the control stimulus (e.g., blank screen).
       - control_response_stddev: The standard deviation of the control responses.
       - control_response_stderr: The standard error of the mean for the control responses.
       - control_individual_responses_real: Vector of real components of individual control trial responses.
       - control_individual_responses_imaginary: Vector of imaginary components of individual control trial responses.
       - control_stimid: The stimulus ID for the control condition.
