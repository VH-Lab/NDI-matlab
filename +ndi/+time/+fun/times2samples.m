function s = times2samples(t,t0_t1,sr)
% TIMES2SAMPLES - convert sample times to sample index numbers / sample numbers

% Given the times of samples in vector T, and a range of times in the recording
% T0_T1 = [ T0 T1 ], and a fixed sample rate SR, calculate the index number of each
% sample S. S(i) is the sample index number of T(i).
