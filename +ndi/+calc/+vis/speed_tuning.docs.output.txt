This calculation object produces a document of type 'ndi_calculation_speedtuning'.

Superclasses: ndi_document, ndi_document_app, speed_tuning

The primary purpose of the ndi_calculation_speedtuning document is to hold the results of a speed_tuning fit. The speed tuning fit document has the following fields:

properties:
	response_units:					The units of the response
	response_type:					The category of the response (e.g. mean)
tuning_curve:
	spatial_frequency:				The set of spatial frequency values
	temporal_frequency:				The set of temporal frequency values
	mean:						The mean response
	stddev:						The standard deviation on the set of generated responses
	stderr:						The standard error on the set of generated responses
	individual:					The individual generated response values
	raw_individual:					The unprocessed generated response values
	control_individual:				The generated response values of the control group
significance:
	visual_response_anova_p:			The p-value relating the different mean response values between the raw and control groups
	across_stimuli_anova_p:				The p-value relating the different mean response values generated by different stimuli
fit:
	Priebe_fit_parameters:				The seven parameters (defined in the general document) used in the modified two-dimensional Gaussian function to fit a speed tuning curve
	Priebe_fit_spatial_frequencies:			The range of spatial frequency values
	Priebe_fit_temporal_frequencies:		The range of temporal frequency values
	Priebe_fit_values:				The calculated parameters generated by fitting a speed tuning curve to a set of responses.
	Priebe_fit_speed_tuning_index:			Provides an index of the relationship between preferred speed and spatial frequency
	Priebe_fit_spatial_frequency_preference:	The spatial frequency averaged across temporal frequencies that a given neuron optimally responds
	Priebe_fit_temporal_frequency_preference:	The temporal frequency averaged across spatial frequencies that a given neuron optimally responds
