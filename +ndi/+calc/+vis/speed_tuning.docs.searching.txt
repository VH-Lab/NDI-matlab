By default, this ndi.calc.vis.speed looks for stimulus_tuningcurve documents that have 'spatial_frequency' and 'temporal_frequency' as the independent_variable_label fields of the stimulus_tuningcurve, and no other independent_variable_label entries. That is, it searches for stimulus_tuningcurve documents that have variation in both spatial frequency and temporal frequency and nothing else.

If one wanted to restrict this further, one might add an additional condition to the default query.

Example:
% only perform the operation on the element called myelement

DQ = c.default_search_for_input_parameters();
DQ.query = DQ.query & ndi.query('','depends_on','element_id',myelement);
c.run('Replace',DQ);
