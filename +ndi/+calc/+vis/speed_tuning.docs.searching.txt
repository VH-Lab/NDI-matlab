By default, this ndi.calc.vis.speed object looks for stimulus_tuningcurve documents that have 'spatial_frequency' and 'temporal_frequency' as the independent_variable_label fields of the stimulus_tuningcurve with no other independent_variable_label entries. That is, this calculation object searches for stimulus_tuningcurve documents that have variation in both spatial and temporal frequency values and nothing more.

If one wished to restrict this further, one might add an additional condition to the default query.

Example:
% Only perform the operation on the element called myelement

DQ = c.default_search_for_input_parameters();
DQ.query = DQ.query & ndi.query('','depends_on','element_id',myelement);
c.run('Replace',DQ);
