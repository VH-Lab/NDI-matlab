This calculation object computes a fit of speed tuning given a set of stimulus responses at a range of spatial and temporal frequency values as described in Priebe et al. 2006.

The fit function is a modified two-dimensional Gaussian function of the form

R(sf,tf) = A * exp( (-(log(sf)-log(sf0)).^2) / (2*sigma_sf*sigma_sf) ) .* ( exp( -(log(tf)-logtfpsf).^2 ./ (2.*(sigma_tf+zeta*(log(tf)-logtfpsf)).^2) ) - exp(-1/(zeta.^2)))

where

logtfpsf = xi * (log(sf)-log(sf0)) + log(tf0)

and the fit parameters wherein

A is the peak response of the neuron,
zeta is the skew of the temporal frequency tuning curve,
xi is the speed parameter,
sigma_sf is the tuning width of the neuron for spatial frequency,
sigma_tf is the tuning width of the neuron for temporal frequency,
sf0 is the preferred spatial frequency averaged across temporal frequencies, and
tf0 is the preferred temporal frequency averaged across spatial frequencies

are determined by performing a least squares fit.
