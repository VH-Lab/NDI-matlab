This calculation object computes a fit of speed tuning described in Priebe et al. 2006, given a set of stimulus responses at a range of spatial frequencies and temporal frequencies.

The fit function is a modified 2-dimensional Gaussian function, where

R(sf,tf) = BLAH BLAH

and the fit parameters
BLAH BLAH

are determined by performing a least squares fit.
