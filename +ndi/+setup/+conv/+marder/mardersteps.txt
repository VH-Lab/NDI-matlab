1)  Setup ndi session 

For example:

S = ndi.setup.lab('marderlab','745_043',[pwd filesep '745_043']);

2) Set up subject text files, need to look at the log to see how many
motif is: 745_003_01@marderlab.brandeis.edu for first, 02 for second, etc

3) Make the probe table

ndi.setup.conv.marder.abf2probetable(S,'forceIgnore2',true)

4) Edit the probe table

(edit the file called 'probeTable.csv')

(check log to see what cells were stuck)

5) Generate the epochprobemaps

ndi.setup.conv.marder.abfprobetable2probemap(S)

6) Check that the probes are in

S.cache.clear(); 
p = S.getprobes()

7) Generate the metadata

ndi.setup.conv.marder.preptemptable(S)
