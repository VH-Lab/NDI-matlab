Current strategy:

Use Nansen-inspired variables to project each file to a table row that includes many extracted variables

Build sessions and daq systems and epochprobemap.txt files with these parameters










Sessions:

filename2session()



Need a list of variables to extract from each file




SessionRef
SessionPath





Need the reference and path

Store at strain/conditiontype/date





Session Reference is whole string




Subject:
  


Variable:

Conditions:
  {
      V1==DrugProtocol
      V2==Pre
  }
 Result:
  { 
     BathStim: "target", "bathstring"
  }

}
